Date API # The Date API is the oldest API present in browsers which can be used to obtain timing measurements. It allows developers to get dates, and get Unix timestamps with Date.now(). These measurements are much less precise than performance.now(). Before the introduction of newer APIs, attacks used to leverage this API 1.
Implicit Clocks # SharedArrayBuffer and Web Workers # With the introduction of Web Workers, new mechanisms to exchange data between threads were created 2. One of those mechanisms is SharedArrayBuffer which provides memory sharing between the main thread and a worker thread. A malicious website can create an implicit clock by loading a worker running an infinite loop that increments a number in the buffer. This value can then be accessed by the main thread at any time to read how many incrementations were performed.
info
SharedArrayBuffer was removed from browsers with the publication of Spectre. It was reintroduced later in 2020, requiring documents to be in a secure context to make use of the API. Since secure contexts cannot reference any cross-origin content that has not explicitly opted in to being accessed, this means SharedArrayBuffers cannot be used as clocks for some XS-Leaks.
To make use of SharedArrayBuffer in modern browsers, an application needs to explicitly opt in to COOP and COEP by setting the following headers:
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp // Define a function to be ran inside a WebWorker function worker_function() { self.onmessage = function (event) { const sharedBuffer = event.data; const sharedArray = new Uint32Array(sharedBuffer); // Infinitely increase the uint32 number while (true) Atomics.add(sharedArray, 0, 1); }; } // Create the WebWorker from the JS function and invoke it const worker = new Worker( URL.createObjectURL( new Blob([\`(\${worker_function})()\`], { type: &#34;text/javascript&#34; })) ); // Create a Shared buffer between the WebWorker and a document const sharedBuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT); const sharedArray = new Uint32Array(sharedBuffer); worker.postMessage(sharedBuffer); tip
To get the relative time in a main thread, you can use the Atomics API.
Atomics.load(sharedArray, 0); Other Clocks # There are a considerable number of APIs attackers can abuse to create implicit clocks: Broadcast Channel API, Message Channel API, requestAnimationFrame, setTimeout, CSS animations, and others 3 4.

`}),e.add({id:3,href:"/docs/attacks/xs-search/",title:"XS-Search",section:"Attacks",content:`Cross-site search (XS-Search) is an important attack principle in the family of XS-Leaks. This type of attack abuses Query-Based Search Systems to leak user information from an attacker origin 1 2. The original attack uses timing measurements to detect whether or not a search system returns results and works as follows:
Establish a baseline of the time needed for a request to return results (hit), and a baseline for the time needed by a request with no results (miss). Start a timing attack on the request to the search endpoint, brute-forcing the first character (?q=r). If the measurement is under the hit baseline, then add one more character (?q=ra); otherwise try a new one (?q=s). In the end, a full secret (?q=secret) can be leaked. This attack requires multiple timing measurements to be accurate, something which can be improved with inflation techniques and statistical analysis. Furthermore, instead of brute-forcing letter by letter, attackers can search specific words or sentences to leak only the occurrence of results.
The most important part of this attack is its principle, as it can be applied to a number of different XS-Leaks.
Inflation Techniques # The inflation techniques of XS-Search are used to increase the accuracy of the attack to make the two response types (hit or miss) easier to distinguish. The following two mechanisms allow attackers to make better measurements:
If a search system reflects certain GET parameters into the response when returning results, the size of the response increases. This makes the request more distinguishable because the time to prepare the response and send it over the network grows substantially. Force the server to perform more computation work before returning a response. This approach can be applied in search systems offering more expressive query languages (e.g. exclude terms in Gmail needs to process every character in the results). Extended Principle # While the original research around XS-Search focused on timing attacks, the principle of the attack extends to other XS-Leaks. Instead of relying on timing measurements, which are unreliable, attackers can use other XS-Leaks to extract the same information.
In a Query-Based Search System, a user submits queries and gets responses associated with those queries. This action can result in two different outcomes:
The system shows results and the page behaves in a specific way (first state). The system does not show results and the page behaves in a different way than in step 1 (second state). If both behaviors above can be distinguished by a more reliable XS-Leak than timing, then an attacker could perform a more efficient XS-Search attack. For example, if the number of frames on a page varies based on search results (step 1 and 2 are distinguishable), this attack principle can be applied with a Frame Counting XS-Leak which could be more accurate than one using timing measurements.

Unfortunately, blocking certain types of requests introduced a new type of XS-Leaks 1 that allows attackers to detect if CORB was enforced on one request, but wasn&rsquo;t on another. Nevertheless, the introduced XS-Leaks are much less problematic than the issues actively protected by CORB (e.g. Spectre).
info
This is a known issue in Chromium, and while it might remain unfixed, its impact is greatly reduced by the rollout of SameSite Cookies by default in Chromium-based browsers. CORB &amp; Error Events # Attackers can observe when CORB is enforced if a response returns a CORB protected Content-Type (and nosniff) with the status code 2xx which results in CORB stripping the body and headers from the response. Detecting this protection allows an attacker to leak the combination of both the status code (success vs. error) and the Content-Type (protected by CORB or not). This allows the distinction of two possible states as shown in these examples:
One state results in a request being protected by CORB and the second state in a client error (404). One state is protected by CORB and the second state is not. The following steps allow abusing this protection in the context of the first example:
An attacker can embed a cross-origin resource in a script tag which returns 200 OK with text/html as Content-Type and a nosniff Header. To protect sensitive contents from entering the attacker&rsquo;s process, CORB will replace the original response with an empty one. Since an empty response is valid JavaScript, the onerror event won&rsquo;t be fired, onload will fire instead. The attacker triggers a second request (corresponding to a second state), similar to 1., which returns something other than 200 OK. The onerror event will fire. The interesting behavior is that CORB creates a valid resource out of the request which could contain something other than JavaScript (causing an error). Considering a non-CORB environment, both 1. and 4. requests would trigger an error. This introduces an XS-Leak as these situations are now distinguishable.
Detecting the nosniff Header # CORB can also allow attackers to detect when the nosniff header is present in the request. This problem originated due to the fact that CORB is only enforced depending on the presence of this header and some sniffing algorithms. The example below shows two distinguishable states:
CORB will prevent an attacker page which embeds a resource as a script if the resource is served with text/html as Content-Type along with the nosniff header. If the resource does not set nosniff and CORB fails to infer the Content-Type of the page (which remains text/html), a SyntaxError will be fired since the contents can&rsquo;t be parsed as valid JavaScript. This error can be caught by listening to window.onerror as script tags only trigger error events under certain conditions.

A webpage will introduce an XS-Leak if CORP is enforced based on user data.

Previously it was possible to use getComputedStyle() to detect this difference, but now browsers prevent this by always returning values as if the link was visited and limiting what styles can be applied using the selector. 1
So, it may be needed to trick the user into clicking an area that the CSS has affected. This can be done using mix-blend-mode. 2
There are also ways to do it without user interaction such as by abusing render timings. This works because it takes time to paint links in a different color. 3

This issue has been known for years and there are multiple open bugs to be fixed in multiple browsers 1 2 3. There are also publicily available proof of concepts, e.g. Whack a mole game 4 that requires user interaction for a successful leak.

Leaking status code # Tricks to reveal a user&rsquo;s history provide a way to detect the status code of a response cross-site. Chromium-based browsers will only save responses with OK status codes (e.g. 200) to the user&rsquo;s history, but won&rsquo;t add error status codes (e.g. 404). By visiting the target URL in a popup window, it will then either be saved to the history or not depending on the status code. After then placing the same URL on your page with &lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;, it is possible to use one of the manual or automatic techniques described above to leak whether this URL was saved to the history or not.
In some XS-Search scenarios, a search with no results will return a 404 error. Cookies marked SameSite=Lax will be sent in popup windows, and this technique allows such scenarios to be exploited. 5
Evil Captcha # Using CSS, it‚Äôs possible to take an embed out of context.

Abusing autocomplete # If a website uses text inputs and does not opt-out of autocomplete using autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; it may be possible to leak data such as email addresses by tricking the user into pressing the keys to navigate the autocomplete UI for a javascript focused text input.

When received, the server decides whether the request should succeed (e.g. 200) or fail (e.g. 404) based on the provided context. When a response has an error status, an error event is fired by the browser for the page to handle. These errors also cover situations where the parser fails, for example when trying to embed HTML content as an image.
For example, attackers can detect whether a user is logged in to a service by checking if the user has access to resources only available to authenticated users 1. The impact of this XS-Leak varies depending on the application, but it can lead to sophisticated attacks with the ability to deanonymize users 2.
Error events can be thrown from a large variety of HTML tags, and some behaviors vary from browser to browser 3. For instance, the behavior can depend on the loaded resources, HTML tags, presence of certain headers (e.g. nosniff, Content-Type), or the enforcement of default browser protections, etc.

The general approach is to adopt consistent behaviors wherever possible. In specific scenarios, applications might use Subresource Protections to prevent attackers from predicting a URL and going forward with an attack.

Use an iframe and count the number of times the onload event is triggered. Check the value of history.length, which is accessible through any window reference. This provides the number of entries in the history of a victim that were either changed by history.pushState or by regular navigations. To get the value of history.length, an attacker changes the location of the window reference to the target website, then changes back to same-origin, and finally reads the value. Run demo Download Trigger # When an endpoint sets the Content-Disposition: attachment header, it instructs the browser to download the response as an attachment instead of navigating to it. Detecting if this behavior occurred might allow attackers to leak private information if the outcome depends on the state of the victim&rsquo;s account.
Download Navigation (with iframes) # Another way to test for the Content-Disposition: attachment header is to check if a navigation occurred. If a page load causes a download, it does not trigger a navigation and the window stays within the same origin. Run demo
In the snippet below , we&rsquo;ve added a sandboxed iframe with downloads disabled to prevent a download modal from appearing.
// Set the destination URL to test for the download attempt var url = &#39;https://example.org/&#39;; // Create an outer iframe to measure onload event var iframe = document.createElement(&#39;iframe&#39;); // Don&#39;t actually download the file to be stealthy iframe.sandbox = &#39;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&#39;; document.body.appendChild(iframe); // Create an inner iframe to test for the download attempt iframe.srcdoc = \`&lt;iframe src=&#34;\${url}&#34; &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\`; iframe.onload = () =&gt; { try { // If a navigation occurs, the iframe will be cross-origin, // so accessing &#34;inner.origin&#34; will throw an exception iframe.contentWindow.frames[0].origin; console.log(&#39;Download attempt detected&#39;); } catch(e) { console.log(&#39;No download attempt detected&#39;); } } info
When there is no navigation inside an iframe caused by a download attempt, the iframe does not trigger an onload event directly. For this reason, in the example above, an outer iframe was used instead, which listens for an onload event which triggers when subresources finish loading, including iframes. important
This attack works regardless of any Framing Protections, because the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy headers are ignored if Content-Disposition: attachment is specified. Download Navigation (without iframes) # A variation of the technique presented in the previous section can also be effectively tested using window objects. In the snippet below, we&rsquo;ve added a sandboxed iframe with disabled downloads to prevent a download modal from appearing.
// Set the destination URL var url = &#39;https://example.org&#39;; // Don&#39;t actually download the file to be stealthy var iframe = document.createElement(&#39;iframe&#39;); iframe.sandbox = &#39;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&#39;; document.body.appendChild(iframe); // Get a window reference var win = iframe.contentWindow.open(url); // Wait for the window to load. setTimeout(() =&gt; { try { // If a navigation occurs, the iframe will be cross-origin, // so accessing &#34;win.origin&#34; will throw an exception win.origin; parent.console.log(&#39;Download attempt detected&#39;); } catch(e) { parent.console.log(&#39;No download attempt detected&#39;); } }, 2000); Server-Side Redirects # Max redirects # When a page initiates a chain of 3XX redirects, browsers limit the maximum number of redirects to 20 1. This can be used to detect the exact number of redirects occurred for a cross-origin page by following the below approach 2:
As a malicious website, initiate 19 redirects and make the final 20th redirect to the attacked page. If the browser threw a network error, at least one redirect occurred. Repeat the process with 18 redirects. If the browser didn&rsquo;t threw a network error, the number of redirects is known as 20 - issued_redirects. To detect an error one can use Error Events
If performed in a top window, this also works with SameSite lax cookies and other cross-site protections, such as Framing Isolation Policy or Resource Isolation Policy. Run demo
Inflation (Server-Side Errors) # A server-side redirect can be detected from a cross-origin page if the destination URL increases in size and contains an attacker-controlled input (either in the form of a query string parameter or a path). The following technique relies on the fact that it is possible to induce an error in most web-servers by generating large request parameters/paths. Since the redirect increases the size of the URL, it can be detected by sending exactly one character less than the server&rsquo;s maximum capacity. That way, if the size increases, the server will respond with an error that can be detected from a cross-origin page (e.g. via Error Events).
example
An example of this attack can be seen here. Inflation (Client-Side Errors) # Most browsers have a maximum permitted URL length, above which the navigation will be aborted. For example, Chrome limits URLs to a maximum length of 2MB 3. When this limit is exceeded, the browser may exhibit behavior that can be detected from a cross-origin page. The exact URL length limit and oracle behavior depends on the browser.
When requesting a URL with a fragment, the fragment is preserved on server redirects. For example, if //example.org redirects to //example.org/redirected, the browser will navigate to //example.org/redirected#fragment when //example.org#fragment is requested. This allows an attacker to artificially inflate the URL length by adding a large fragment to the URL so that it is exactly one character less than the maximum permitted length.
example
Chrome will navigate to an about:blank page if the URL length is exceeded. An attacker can detect whether a redirect occurred by checking if the page is still on the same origin. Cross-Origin Redirects # CSP Violations # Content-Security-Policy (CSP) is an in-depth defense mechanism against XSS and data injection attacks. When a CSP is violated, a SecurityPolicyViolationEvent is thrown. An attacker can set up a CSP using the connect-src directive which triggers a Violation event every time a fetch follows an URL not set in the CSP directive. This allows an attacker to detect if a redirect to another origin occurred 4 5. Run demo
The example below triggers a SecurityPolicyViolationEvent if the website set in the fetch API (line 6) redirects to a website other than https://example.org:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 &lt;!-- Set the Content-Security-Policy to only allow example.org --&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=&#34;Content-Security-Policy&#34; content=&#34;connect-src https://example.org&#34;&gt; &lt;script&gt; // Listen for a CSP violation event document.addEventListener(&#39;securitypolicyviolation&#39;, () =&gt; { console.log(&#34;Detected a redirect to somewhere other than example.org&#34;); }); // Try to fetch example.org. If it redirects to another cross-site website // it will trigger a CSP violation event fetch(&#39;https://example.org/might_redirect&#39;, { mode: &#39;no-cors&#39;, credentials: &#39;include&#39; }); &lt;/script&gt; When the redirect of interest is cross-site and conditioned on the presence of a cookie marked SameSite=Lax, the approach outlined above won&rsquo;t work, because fetch doesn&rsquo;t count as a top-level navigation. In a case like this, the attacker can use another CSP directive, form-action, and leverage the fact that submitting a HTML form using GET as its method does count as a top-level navigation.
The example below triggers a SecurityPolicyViolationEvent if the form&rsquo;s action (line 3) redirects to a website other than https://example.org:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 &lt;!-- Set the Content-Security-Policy to only allow example.org --&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=&#34;Content-Security-Policy&#34; content=&#34;form-action https://example.org&#34;&gt; &lt;form action=&#34;https://example.org/might_redirect&#34;&gt;&lt;/form&gt; &lt;script&gt; // Listen for a CSP violation event document.addEventListener(&#39;securitypolicyviolation&#39;, () =&gt; { console.log(&#34;Detected a redirect to somewhere other than example.org&#34;); }); // Try to get example.org via a form. If it redirects to another cross-site website // it will trigger a CSP violation event document.forms[0].submit(); &lt;/script&gt; Note that this approach is unviable in Firefox (contrary to Chromium-based browsers) because form-action doesn&rsquo;t block redirects after a form submission in that browser.
Case Scenarios # An online bank decides to redirect wealthy users to attractive stock opportunities by triggering a navigation to a reserved space on the website when these users consult their account balance. If this is only done for a specific group of users, it becomes possible for an attacker to leak the &ldquo;client status&rdquo; of the user.
Partitioned HTTP Cache Bypass # If a site example.com includes a resource from *.example.com/resource then that resource will have the same caching key as if the resource was directly requested through top-level navigation. That is because the caching key is consisted of top-level eTLD+1 and frame eTLD+1. 6
Because a window can prevent a navigation to a different origin with window.stop() and the on-device cache is faster than the network, it can detect if a resource is cached by checking if the origin changed before the stop() could be run.
async function ifCached_window(url) { return new Promise(resolve =&gt; { checker.location = url; // Cache only setTimeout(() =&gt; { checker.stop(); }, 20); // Get result setTimeout(() =&gt; { try { let origin = checker.origin; // Origin has not changed before timeout. resolve(false); } catch { // Origin has changed. resolve(true); checker.location = &#34;about:blank&#34;; } }, 50); }); } Create window (makes it possible to go back after a successful check)
let checker = window.open(&#34;about:blank&#34;); Usage
await ifCached_window(&#34;https://example.org&#34;); info
Partitioned HTTP Cache Bypass can be prevented using the header Vary: Sec-Fetch-Site as that splits the cache by its initiator, see Cache Protections. It works because the attack only applies for the resources from the same site, hence Sec-Fetch-Site header will be cross-site for the attacker compared to same-site or same-origin for the website.

Neither COOP nor Framing Protections helps with the mitigation of the redirect leaks because when the header Content-Disposition is present, other headers are being ignored.

These attacks have had different levels of impact over time, gaining new attention when browsers started shipping high-precision timers like performance.now().
To obtain timing measurements, attackers must use a clock, either an implicit or an explicit one. These clocks are usually interchangeable for the purposes of XS-Leaks and only vary in accuracy and availability. For simplicity, this article assumes the use of the performance.now() API, an explicit clock present in all modern browsers.
This side-channel allows attackers to infer information from a cross-site request based on how much time it takes to complete that request 3. The network timing measurement may vary based on the user state and it&rsquo;s usually connected to the:
Resource size. Computation time in the backend. Number and size of sub-resources. Cache status. tip
Learn more about the different types of clocks in the Clocks article. Modern Web Timing Attacks # The performance.now() API can be used to measure how much time it takes to perform a request:
// Start the clock var start = performance.now() // Measure how long it takes to complete the fetch requests fetch(&#39;https://example.org&#39;, { mode: &#39;no-cors&#39;, credentials: &#39;include&#39; }).then(() =&gt; { // When fetch finishes, calculate the difference var time = performance.now() - start; console.log(&#34;The request took %d ms.&#34;, time); }); Onload events # A similar process can be used to measure how long it takes to fetch a resource by simply watching for an onload event:
// Create a script element pointing to the page we want to time var script = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;); script.src = &#34;https://example.org&#34;; document.body.appendChild(script); // Start the clock var start = performance.now(); // When script loads, caculate the time it took to finish the request script.onload = () =&gt; { var time = performance.now() - start; console.log(&#34;The request took %d ms.&#34;, time) } tip
A similar technique can be used for other HTML elements, e.g. &lt;img&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, or &lt;iframe&gt;, which could be used in scenarios where other techniques fail. For example, if Fetch Metadata blocks loading a resource into a script tag, it may allow loading it into an image tag. tip
An alternative way could be to use image.complete property. More information here. Cross-window Timing Attacks # An attacker can also measure the network timing of a page by opening a new window with window.open and waiting for the window to start loading. The snippet below shows how to make this measurement:
// Open a new window to measure when the iframe starts loading var win = window.open(&#39;https://example.org&#39;); // Measure the initial time var start = performance.now(); // Define the loop function measure(){ try{ // If the page has loaded, then it will be on a different origin // so \`win.origin\` will throw an exception win.origin; // If the window is still same-origin, immediately repeat the loop but // without blocking the event loop setTimeout(measure, 0); }catch(e){ // Once the window has loaded, calculate the time difference var time = performance.now() - start; console.log(&#39;It took %d ms to load the window&#39;, time); } } // Initiate the loop that breaks when the window switches origins measure(); note
Note that this POC uses setTimeout in order to create the rough equivalent of a while(true) loop. It is necessary to implement it in this way in order to avoid blocking the JS event loop. tip
This technique can also be adapted to measure the Execution Timing of a page by making the event loop busy. Unload events # The unload and beforeunload events can be used to measure the time it takes to fetch a resource. This works because beforeunload is triggered when the browser requests a new navigation request, while unload is triggered when that navigation actually occurs. Because of this behaviour, it is possible to calculate the time difference between these two events and measure the time it took the browser to complete fetching the resource.
info
The time difference between unload and beforeunload is not affected by the x-frame-options (XFO) header, because the event is triggered before the browser learns about the response headers. The below snippet makes use of the SharedArrayBuffer clock which needs to be initiated before the snippet is ran:
// Create a Shared buffer to be used by a WebWorker var sharedBuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT); var sharedArray = new Uint32Array(sharedBuffer); // Follow the steps of initiating the WebWorker and then call worker.postMessage(sharedBuffer); var start; iframe.contentWindow.onbeforeunload = () =&gt; { // Get the &#34;time&#34; during the navigation start = Atomics.load(sharedArray, 0); } iframe.contentWindow.onpagehide = () =&gt; { // Get the &#34;time&#34; after the navigation var end = Atomics.load(sharedArray, 0); console.log(&#39;The difference between events was %d iterations&#39;, end - start); }; tip
The SharedArrayBuffer clock was used to create a high-resolution timer. However, the time difference between the beforeunload and unload events of iframes can be measured with other clocks as well, e.g. performance.now(). tip
The presented snippet makes use of iframes to make the measurement. A variation of this attack can also use window references, which is harder to protect against. Sandboxed Frame Timing Attacks # If a page doesn&rsquo;t have any Framing Protections implemented, an attacker can time how long it takes for the page and all subresources to load over the network. By default, the onload handler for an iframe is invoked after all the resources have been loaded and all JavaScript has finished executing. But, an attacker can eliminate the noise of script execution by including the sandbox attribute in the &lt;iframe&gt;. This attribute blocks a lot of features including JavaScript execution, which results in almost pure network measurement.
var iframe = document.createElement(&#39;iframe&#39;); // Set the URL of the destination website iframe.src = &#34;https://example.org&#34;; // Set sandbox attribute to block script execution iframe.sandbox = &#34;&#34;; document.body.appendChild(iframe); // Measure the time before the request was initiated var start = performance.now(); iframe.onload = () =&gt; { // When iframe loads, calculate the time difference var time = performance.now() - start; console.log(&#34;The iframe and subresources took %d ms to load.&#34;, time) } Timeless Timing Attacks # Other types of attacks do not consider the notion of time to perform a timing attack 4. Timeless attacks consist of fitting two HTTP requests (the baseline and the attacked request) in a single packet, to guarantee they arrive to the server at the same time. The server will process the requests concurrently, and return a response based on their execution time as soon as possible. One of the two requests will arrive first, allowing the attacker to infer the time difference by comparing the order in which the requests arrived.
The advantage of this technique is the independence from network jitter and uncertain delays, something that is always present in the remaining techniques.

The concept has been known since the beginning of the web 1 and initially relied on detecting timing differences.
When a user visits a website, some resources such as images, scripts, and HTML content are fetched and later cached by the browser (under certain conditions). This optimization makes future navigations faster as the browser serves those resources from disk instead of requesting them again. If an attacker can detect which resources are cached, this information can be enough to leak whether a user accessed a specific page in the past.
A variation of Cache Probing abuses Error Events to perform more accurate and impactful attacks.
Attack Principle # An attacker wants to know whether a user visited a certain social network:
When the user visits the social network some of the subresources are cached. The user visits an attacker-controlled page which fetches a resource that is usually fetched by the social network. Using a Network Timing XS-Leak, the attacker page can detect the difference between a response coming from the cache (i.e. step 1 occurred) or coming from the network (i.e. step 1 did not occur): the delay is significantly lower if a request is served from the cache. Cache Probing with Error Events # Cache Probing with Error Events 2 allows more accurate attacks. Instead of relying on timing measurements, this approach leverages Error Events and some server-side behavior to detect whether a resource was cached. The attack requires the following steps:
Invalidating the resource from the browser cache. This step is required to make sure the attack does not consider a resource previously cached in another visit. Performing a request that causes different items to be cached depending on the user&rsquo;s state. For example, loading a page that includes a specific image only if the user is logged in. This request can be triggered by navigating to the target website with &lt;link rel=prerender.., embedding the website in an iframe, or opening a new window with window.open. Triggering a request that causes the server to reject the request. For example, including an overlong referer header that makes the server reject the request. If the resource was cached in step 2, this request succeeds instead of triggering an error event. Invalidating the cache with errors # To invalidate a resource from the cache, the attacker must force the server to return an error when fetching that subresource. There are a couple of ways to achieve this:
A request with an overlong referer header and 'cache':'reload'. This might not work as browsers capped the length of the referrer to prevent this. Request headers such as Content-Type, Accept, Accept-Language, etc. that may cause the server to fail (more application dependent). Other request properties. Often, some of these methods might be considered a bug in the browser (e.g. this bug).
Invalidating the cache without errors # It&rsquo;s also possible to remove resources from cache without server errors. For example, the above techniques could be used as well:
A fetch request with a cache:'reload' option that is aborted with AbortController.abort() before new content has been received, but after the request was initiated by the browser. A POST request from a fetch with no-cors. Run demo A POST request from a HTMLFormElement may purge using the key of the top-level site to bypass the Partitioned HTTP Cache Exceed the browser cache limit. CORS error on Origin Reflection misconfiguration # Origin reflection is a behavior in which a globally accessible resource is provided with a Access-Control-Allow-Origin (ACAO) header whose value reflects the origin that initialized the request. This can be considered as CORS misconfiguration 3 and can be used to detect whether the resource exists in the browser cache.
info
For example, Flask framework promotes origin reflection as the default behavior. If a resource hosted on server.com is requested from target.com then the origin could be reflected in the response headers as: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: target.com. If the resource is cached, this information is stored together with the resource in the browser cache. With that, if attacker.com tries to fetch the same resource there are two possible scenarios:
The resource is not in cache: the resource could be fetched and stored together with the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: attacker.com header. The resource was already in cache: fetch attempt will try to fetch the resource from the cache but it will also generate a CORS error due to the ACAO header value mismatch with the requesting origin (target.com origin was expected but attacker.com was provided). Here below is provided an example code snippet exploiting this vulnerability to infer the cache status of the victim&rsquo;s browser. Run demo // The function simply takes a url and fetches it in CORS mode. // If the fetch raises an error, it will be a CORS error due to the // origin mismatch between attacker.com and victim&#39;s IP. function ifCached(url) { // returns a promise that resolves to true on fetch error // and to false on success return fetch(url, { mode: &#34;cors&#34; }) .then(() =&gt; false) .catch(() =&gt; true); } // This makes sense only if the attacker already knows that // server.com suffers from origin reflection CORS misconfiguration. var resource_url = &#34;server.com/reflected_origin_resource.html&#34; var verdict = await ifCached(resource_url) console.log(&#34;Resource was cached: &#34; + verdict) tip
The best way to mitigate this is to avoid origin reflection and use the header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * for globally accessible and unauthenticated resources. Fetch with AbortController # The below snippet shows how the AbortController interface could be combined with fetch and setTimeout to both detect whether the resource is cached and to evict a specific resource from the browser cache. A nice feature of this technique is that the probing occurs without caching new content in the process.
async function ifCached(url, purge = false) { var controller = new AbortController(); var signal = controller.signal; // After 9ms, abort the request (before the request was finished). // The timeout might need to be adjusted for the attack to work properly. // Purging content seems to take slightly less time than probing var wait_time = (purge) ? 3 : 9; var timeout = await setTimeout(() =&gt; { controller.abort(); }, wait_time); try { // credentials option is needed for Firefox let options = { mode: &#34;no-cors&#34;, credentials: &#34;include&#34;, signal: signal }; // If the option &#34;cache: reload&#34; is set, the browser will purge // the resource from the browser cache if(purge) options.cache = &#34;reload&#34;; await fetch(url, options); } catch (err) { // When controller.abort() is called, the fetch will throw an Exception if(purge) console.log(&#34;The resource was purged from the cache&#34;); else console.log(&#34;The resource is not cached&#34;); return false } // clearTimeout will only be called if this line was reached in less than // wait_time which means that the resource must have arrived from the cache clearTimeout(timeout); console.log(&#34;The resource is cached&#34;); return true; } // purge https://example.org from the cache await ifCached(&#39;https://example.org&#39;, true); // Put https://example.org into the cache // Skip this step to simulate a case where example.org is not cached open(&#39;https://example.org&#39;); // wait 1 second (until example.org loads) await new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Check if https://example.org is in the cache await ifCached(&#39;https://example.org&#39;); Defense # Currently, there are no good defense mechanisms that would allow websites to fully protect against Cache Probing attacks. Nonetheless, a website can mitigate the attack surface by deploying Cache Protections such as:
Cache-control headers used to prevent the resource from caching. Random Tokens used to make the URLs unpredictable for attackers. Vary: Sec-Fetch-Site used to segregate the cache by a group of origins. User content that is capable of making networks requests should be on its own eTLD+1 by using a separate domain or the public suffix list (if applicable) to allow for partitioned caches. A promising defense against Cache Probing attacks is partitioning the HTTP cache by the requesting origin. This browser-provided protection prevents an attacker&rsquo;s origin from interfering with cached resources of other origins.
info
As of September 2021, Partitioned Caches is available in most browsers to split the cache by eTLD+1, however applications cannot rely on them. The protection is ineffective for requests from subdomains and window navigations Real World Example # An attacker using Error Events Cache Probing was able to detect whether a user watched a specific YouTube Video by checking if the video thumbnail ended up in browser cache 4.

Timing the Event Loop # JavaScript&rsquo;s concurrency model is based on a single-threaded event loop which means it can only run one task at a time. If, for example, some time-consuming task blocks the event loop, the user can perceive a freeze on a page as a result of the UI thread being starved. Other tasks must wait until the blocking task finishes. Each browser implements different process models, which means some web sites might run in different threads (and event loops) depending on their relations.
Some techniques can exploit this model to steal secrets from a cross-origin page:
Inferring how long code from a different origin takes to run by measuring how long it takes to run next in the event pool 1 2. The attacker keeps sending events to the event loop with fixed properties, which will eventually be dispatched if the pool is empty. Other origins dispatch events to the same pool, and this is where an attacker infers the time difference by detecting if a delay occurred with one of its tasks. Stealing a secret from a cross-origin page if the said secret is being compared by an attacker-controlled string. The leak is a result of comparing time differences in the event loop of a char-by-char string comparison 2 (using the previous technique). In browsers without process isolation, cross-window communications between different origins run in the same thread, thus sharing the same event loop. important
The latter attack is no longer possible in browsers with process isolation mechanisms in place. Such mechanisms are currently only present in Chromium-based browsers with Site Isolation; they are coming to Firefox soon under the name Project Fission. Busy Event Loop # Another technique used to measure JavaScript execution consists of blocking the event loop of a thread and timing how long it takes for the event loop to become available again. One of the main advantages of this technique is its ability to circumvent Site Isolation, as an attacker origin can influence the execution of another origin. The attack works as follows:
Navigate the target website in a separate window with window.open or inside an iframe (if Framing Protections are not in place). Wait for the long computation to start. Load any same-site page inside an iframe, regardless of any Framing Protections. An attacker can detect how long the target website is executed by timing how long it took for the iframe (in step 3) to trigger the onload event (Network Timing of step 3 should be minimal). Since both navigations occurred within the same context and they are same-site, they run in the same thread and share the same event loop (they can block each other).
// Open a new window to measure how long the window blocks the event loop // for the site example.org window.open(&#39;https://example.org/expensive&#39;); // TODO: Wait for the expensive window to load, e.g. via timeout // then create an iframe to the same site var ifr = document.createElement(&#39;iframe&#39;); ifr.src = &#34;https://example.org&#34;; document.body.appendChild(ifr); // Measure the initial time var start = performance.now(); ifr.onload = () =&gt; { // When the iframe loads calculate the time difference var time = performance.now() - start; console.log(&#39;It took %d ms to load the window&#39;, time); } Service Workers # Service Workers can be used to offer offline solutions to web applications, but they can be abused by attackers to measure the timing of JavaScript execution3. They serve as a proxy between the browser and the network and allow applications to intercept any network requests made by the main thread (document).
To make a timing measurement, an attacker can perform the following steps:
The attacker registers a service worker in one of their domains (attacker.com). In the main document, the attacker issues a navigation (window.open) to the target website and instructs the Service Worker to start a timer. When the new window starts loading, the attacker navigates the reference obtained in step 2 to a page handled by the Service Worker. When the request performed in step 3 arrives at the service worker, it returns a 204 (No Content) response, which aborts the navigation. At this point, the Service Worker collects a measurement from the timer started in step 2. This measurement is affected by how long JavaScript blocked the navigation. Since no navigation actually occurs, steps 3 to 5 can be repeated to obtain more measurements on successive JavaScript execution timings.
jQuery, CSS Selectors &amp; Short-circuit Timing # Attackers can abuse another interesting behavior of CSS selectors which is short-circuit evaluation of expressions. This expression is received in a URL hash and evaluated if the page executes jQuery(location.hash) 4.
A timing attack is possible because the expression is compared from right to left, so if the selector main[id='site-main'] does not match and fails to evaluate, the other parts of the selector (*:has(*:has(*:has(*))))), which take longer to execute, are ignored (just like the and operator, but backwards).
$(&#34;*:has(*:has(*:has(*)) *:has(*:has(*:has(*))) *:has(*:has(*:has(*)))) main[id=&#39;site-main&#39;]&#34;) tip
In browsers with process isolation mechanisms, Service Workers can be abused to obtain the execution timing measurement or tricks like Busy Event Loop tricks can be used to circumvent Site Isolation. ReDoS # warning
This group of XS-Leaks requires an injection of Regex Expressions on the target page. Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a technique which results in a Denial of Service in applications that allow regex as user input 2 5. Maliciously crafted regular expressions can be made to run in exponential time. This can be used as an XS-Leak vector if a regex can be injected that has a different runtime depending on the data on the page. This could happen on the client-side or the server-side.

Network delays Document parsing Retrieval and processing of subresources Code execution Some of the factors differ in value depending on the application. This means that Network Timing might be more significant for pages with more backend processing, while Execution Timing can be more significant in applications processing and displaying data within the browser. Attackers can also eliminate some of these factors to obtain more precise measurements. For example, an attacker could preload all of the subresources by embedding the page as an iframe (forcing the browser to cache the subresources) and then perform a second measurement, which excludes any delay introduced by the retrieval of those subresources.
Frame Timing Attacks (Hybrid) # If a page does not set Framing Protections, an attacker can obtain a hybrid measurement that considers all of the factors. This attack is similar to a Network-based Attack, but when the resource is retrieved, the page is rendered and executed by the browser (subresources fetched and JavaScript executed).

This can be detected cross-origin by loading https://example.com/foo#bar in an iframe; if there is an element with id=&quot;bar&quot;, the focus event fires. The blur event can also be used for the same purpose 1.

This group of XS-Leaks requires a CSS injection on the target page. Among the different CSS injection vectors, the most noticeable one is the abuse of CSS Selectors. They can be used as an expression to match and select certain HTML elements. For example, the selector input[value^=&quot;a&quot;] is matched if the value of an input tag starts with the character &ldquo;a&rdquo;. So, to detect if a CSS Selector matches the expression, attackers can trigger a callback to one of their websites using certain properties like background, @import, etc. 1 2. The matching process can easily be brute-forced, and extended to the full string.
Page content such as JavaScript can be leaked by abusing Font ligatures as a sequence of characters can have its own representation.
Some HTML tags that are normally hidden such as style and script can be rendered as text by applying a style like * { display: block; }. Hence, their content could be potentially leaked as well.
Larger text dimensions can result in the scroll bar being shown,
This scroll bar can have a custom style such as background: url() so that it makes a request to an attacker-controlled server when shown. 3
If loading external images for exfiltration is disallowed by a CSP img-src directive, you may still be able to use font URLs if they are not blocked by font-src, connect-src or default-src directives. You must first define a @font-face { font-family: a; src: url(...) }, and then reference it in a selector like input[value^=&quot;a&quot;] { font-family: a }. This works because the font will only be loaded if it is required by some element on the page.
If no external requests can be made at all due to a strict CSP, it is still possible to use an XS-Leak based on browser crashing. At the time of writing, Chromium crashes when trying to render the background: linear-gradient(in display-p3, red, blue) property 4. Using CSS selectors this can be done conditionally.
Because of Full Site Isolation, if one page of a site crashes, all other active frames of that site crash too. This is detectable by creating a dummy iframe on the attacker&rsquo;s page of the same site with any path, and measuring onload= events. By then conditionally crashing CSS in another iframe or popup window, you can detect the result of a single CSS selector by the dummy iframe crashing with it. Doing this repeatedly allows reading larger strings. 5
This last attack is often not fully mitigated by Framing Protections because any page on the same site with a %00 error or a too long URI can serve as the dummy frame, which may be missing the regular response headers. The alternative becomes using popup windows, and only if the COOP protection is active will it be fully mitigated.

Defending against XS-Leaks effectively requires a mixture of different techniques, each of which is described in detail below.
Opt-in Mechanisms # These defense mechanisms allow applications to address classes of similar XS-Leaks at the same time. These protections can either allow applications to change the behavior of the browser or provide additional information that applications can use to change their own behavior.
tip
Deploying a combination of opt-in defense mechanisms should be the default strategy. Not only do they protect against XS-Leaks, but also against other vulnerabilities such as XSSI, Clickjacking, CSRF, etc. important
When using any mitigations that rely on browser support, be sure to check that they are well supported by your customers&rsquo; browsers. For example, fetch metadata headers are a great tool, but are currently only supported in Chromium-based browsers. Check MDN for up-to-date information on browser support for different standards. Application Design # Application design techniques are focused on carefully designing the application in a way that prevents XS-Leaks. This is a very useful approach when it is not practical to enable stronger global protections immediately. The other big advantage is that careful application design can stop XS-Leaks even on older browsers that don&rsquo;t support the newest browser standards.
note
It is very difficult to use application design techniques to block every XS-Leak technique across an entire application. While application design techniques are effective at stopping severe leaks, opt-in mechanisms provided by the browser are a better overall solution. Secure Defaults # Browser vendors are actively working on changing default behaviors to help mitigate some of the XS-Leaks mentioned in this wiki. Changing default behaviors is a balancing act between improving security and preserving backwards compatibility.
important
Secure defaults are amazing! They can help protect applications and users without any additional effort from developers. But note that they&rsquo;re unlikely to completely prevent XS-Leaks. References # Google Bughunter University - XSLeaks and XS-Search, link&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

`}),e.add({id:35,href:"/docs/defenses/opt-in/fetch-metadata/",title:"Fetch Metadata",section:"Opt-In Mechanisms",content:`Fetch Metadata Request Headers are sent by browsers with HTTPS requests. These headers provide context on how a request was initiated so that applications are able to make more informed decisions on how to respond to them. This allows servers to behave differently when they detect potential attacks (e.g. unexpected cross-origin requests). This can be very effective against cross-origin attacks like XSSI, XS-Leaks, Clickjacking, and CSRF if a strict policy is deployed on the server.
In the XS-Leaks scenario, servers have the ability to know when a request was made cross-origin (e.g. attacker origin) and can return a different response with no user data. This kind of response is not useful to the attacker since it does not carry any information or state about the user. Fetch Metadata can also be used to block framing or even navigational requests.
important
For security reasons, Fetch Metadata headers are only attached to encrypted (HTTPS) requests. Fetch Metadata vs. SameSite cookies # Fetch Metadata headers can be used to extend the protections provided by SameSite cookies. While both Fetch Metadata headers and SameSite cookies can be used to reject cross-site requests, Fetch Metadata can make more informed decisions based on factors like:
Was the request same-origin or same-site? How was the request initiated? (e.g. fetch, script, top navigation) Was the request initiated by user interaction? Was the request initiated by the browser (e.g. by entering the URL directly in the omnibox)? This allows for a more precise deployment of protections in scenarios where SameSite cookies could break a service&rsquo;s functionalities. One disadvantage of Fetch Metadata compared to SameSite cookies is that the latter can also protect unencrypted requests (HTTP) while the former can&rsquo;t.
Considerations # Fetch Metadata headers are a useful tool for a defense-in-depth strategy, but should not be seen as a replacement for mechanisms such as SameSite Cookies, COOP, or Framing Protections. Even though Fetch Metadata headers can be used to achieve similar results, it is a best practice to enforce these restrictions on the client side in addition to the server.
The usefulness of Fetch Metadata headers is dependent on the application coverage and correctness of the deployment.
Policies # See Resource Isolation Policy and Framing Isolation Policy for specific policies utilizing Fetch Metadata Request Headers.
`}),e.add({id:36,href:"/docs/defenses/design-protections/cache-protections/",title:"Cache Protections",section:"Application Design",content:`There are a number of different approaches applications can use to defend against cache probing-based XS-Leaks. These approaches are explained in the following sections.
Cache Protection via Cache-Control Headers # If it is acceptable to disable caching, doing so provides a strong defense against cache probing attacks. Disabling caching means that every time someone loads a resource, the resource has to be fetched again. To disable caching, set a Cache-Control: no-store header on every single response that you wish to protect.
Advantages:
Supported by all major browsers Disadvantages:
Negatively impacts site performance Cache Protection via Random Tokens # Rather than disabling caching, applications can include additional data in URLs in order to defend against cache probing attacks. This can be achieved by including a random token in the URL of every subresource that you reference. If an attacker cannot guess this random token, then the attacker cannot determine whether items are in the cache via any straightforward techniques.
example
Suppose that every page on your application loads the user&rsquo;s profile photo: /user/&lt;USERNAME&gt;.png. An attacker could check which user is signed in by probing the cache for /user/john.png, /user/jane.png, and so on.
This is where a random token can come into play. If implemented, the application takes the user&rsquo;s profile photo from /user/&lt;USERNAME&gt;.png?cache_buster=&lt;RANDOM_TOKEN&gt; on every load. The server does not need to do anything with this random token. It is there purely to ensure that there is no way for an attacker to probe the cache without knowing the random token.
If implemented carefully, an application could even have a user-specific random token that is reused across page loads. This would allow subresources to still be cached since the URL would remain constant for a given user.
Advantages:
Supported by every major browser Does not break caching Disadvantages:
Difficult to implement Cache Protection via Fetch Metadata # Fetch-Metadata is meant to allow servers to determine how and why a request was initiated on the client side. One piece of information that is exposed is the Sec-Fetch-Site header which specifies whether a request is coming from the same origin or a different origin. This can be combined with the Vary header in order to force the browser to segment the cache based on whether a request is made from the same origin or a different origin.
This is done by setting Vary: Sec-Fetch-Site on all resources you wish to protect.
example
Assume we have the resource cdn.example.com/image.png that we wish to protect from cache probing attacks. If we set Vary: Sec-Fetch-Site on it, this leads to the following behavior:
If example.com tries to load the resource, the request is initiated by the same site so it is cached under (SFS: same-site, resource_url) If cdn.example.com tries to load the resource, the request is initiated by the same origin so it is cached under (SFS: same-origin, resource_url) If evil.com tries to load the resource, the request is initiated by a different site so it is cached under (SFS: cross-site, resource_url) Note that this means cross-site requests are separated from same-site and same-origin requests.
Advantages:
Does not break caching Disadvantages:

Browsers use sockets to communicate with servers. As the operating system and the hardware it runs on have limited resources, browsers have to impose a limit. Run demo (Chrome) Run demo (Firefox)
To exploit the existence of this limit, attackers can:
Check what the limit of the browser is, for example 256 global sockets for TCP and 6000 global sockets for UDP. 23 Block \\(255\\) sockets for a long period of time by performing \\(255\\) requests to different hosts that simply hang the connection // Client for(let i=0; i&lt;255; i++) fetch(&#39;https://&#39;+i+&#39;.example.com/&#39;, {mode: &#34;no-cors&#34;, cache: &#34;no-store&#34;}); # Server from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer import time class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler): def do_GET(self): time.sleep(float(100000)) self.send_response(200) self.send_header(&#39;Cache-Control&#39;, &#39;no-store&#39;) self.end_headers() with HTTPServer((&#39;&#39;, 8000), handler) as server: server.serve_forever() Use the \\(256^{th}\\) socket by performing a request to the target page. Perform a \\(257^{th}\\) request to another host. Since all the sockets are being used (in steps 2 and 3), this request must wait until the pool receives an available socket. This waiting period provides the attacker with the network timing of the \\(256^{th}\\) socket, which belongs to the target page. This works because the \\(255\\) sockets in step 2 are still blocked, so if the pool received an available socket, it was caused by the release of the socket in step 3. The time to release the \\(256^{th}\\) socket is directly connected with the time taken to complete the request. performance.clearResourceTimings(); await fetch(location.href, {cache: &#34;no-store&#34;}); await new Promise(r =&gt; setTimeout(r, 1000)); let data = performance.getEntries().pop(); let type = (data.connectStart === data.startTime) ? &#39;reused&#39; : &#39;new&#39;; console.log(&#39;Time spent: &#39; + data.duration + &#39; on &#39; + type + &#39; connection.&#39;); Connection reuse # With HTTP/1.1 (TCP) and HTTP/2 (TCP) and HTTP/3 (UDP) requests may reuse an existing connection for a host to improve performance. 45 HTTP/2 also has Connection Coalescing which allows different hostnames that are accessible from the same web server to reuse a connection. 6 This is currently keyed by if credentials are included in the request. Since a reused connection is normally faster this could allow for detecting if a site has connected to a host excluding anything that‚Äôs been cached and leaking information about the cross-site request by abusing Stream prioritization and HPACK compression. 7 Connections may get closed if they are left idle or the sockets are exhausted, for example 256 connections for HTTP/2 or 30 seconds idle for HTTP/3. 28 This may also leak when the connection happened and the browser can have per connection limits and on how many connections are allowed per host, for example 6 connections per host. 2

This protection was created to defend against speculative side-channel attacks such as Spectre that allow attackers to read the memory of the process that both cross-site pages (e.g. attacker.com and sensitive.com) were embedded into. CORB aims to prevent attackers from loading certain sensitive cross-origin resources into an attacker-controlled process. For example, if an attacker tries to load cross-origin HTML, XML, or JSON into an img tag, CORB prevents this from happening. With CORB, the scenario is treated as though the server returned no data.
To classify resources, CORB uses the Content-Type header, the nosniff header, and a variety of other heuristics.
info
Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP) is an opt-in protection which enforces and extends CORB. When using CORB, be aware of the following facts:
Currently, only Chromium-based browsers support CORB. CORB does not protect against navigational requests. This means that in browsers that do not support out-of-process iframes, a CORB-protected resource may still end up in another origin&rsquo;s process if framing protections are not used. CORB introduces a new XS-Leak technique since attackers may be able to observe the results of CORB. This can lead to a variety of information leaks. However, in most cases, these information leaks have a lower impact than the data that could be leaked via speculative execution attacks.

Framing Protections can ensure that an attacker cannot use iframes to access the window object, but this does not stop an attacker from accessing the window object from an opened window through window.open(url) or window.opener references.
Exploiting XS-Leaks with window.open is generally seen as the least appealing option for an attacker because the user can see it happen in the open browser window. However, it&rsquo;s usually the right technique when:
A page sets Framing Protections. A page sets Same-Site Cookies with Lax Mode (in contrast to the Strict mode, navigating a top-level window is allowed by the Lax mode). To prevent other websites from gaining arbitrary window references to a page, applications can deploy Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) 1 2.
There are three possible values for the COOP header:
unsafe-none ‚Äì This is the default value and is how websites behave if no value is set. same-origin ‚Äì This is the strictest value. If you set same-origin, then cross-origin websites cannot get access to your window object through opening new windows. If your application relies on using window.open to open another website and communicate with it, this will be blocked by same-origin. If this is an issue, set same-origin-allow-popups instead. same-origin-allow-popups ‚Äì This value allows your website to use window.open, but does not allow other websites to use window.open against your application. If possible, it is recommended to set same-origin. If you set same-origin-allow-popups, be sure to review what websites you open with window.open and ensure that they are trusted.
Considerations # Since COOP is an opt-in mechanism and a very recent one, it can easily be overlooked by developers and security engineers. Nonetheless, it‚Äôs important to highlight the importance of this defense mechanism as it is the only way to prevent attackers from exploiting XS-Leaks which make use of window references returned by APIs like window.open (unless SameSite Cookies in the Strict mode can be widely deployed).

This protection complements CORB since it is an opt-in defense, whereas CORB blocks some cross-origin reads by default. CORP is designed to protect against both speculative execution attacks and XS-Leaks by allowing developers to ensure that sensitive resources cannot end up in attacker-controlled processes. Unlike CORB, this protection is enforced in the browser only if an application opts in to the protection. Applications can define which groups of origins (&lsquo;same-site&rsquo;, &lsquo;same-origin&rsquo;, &lsquo;cross-site&rsquo;) are allowed to read their resources.
If an application sets a certain resource CORP header as &lsquo;same-site&rsquo; or &lsquo;same-origin&rsquo;, an attacker is incapable of reading that resource. This is a very strong and highly encouraged protection.

CORP does not protect against navigational requests. This means that in browsers that do not support out-of-process iframes, a CORP-protected resource may still end up in another origin&rsquo;s process if framing protections are not used.

If an attacker is unable to embed the contents of a page as an iframe, frame, embed or object, then the attack may no longer be possible. To mitigate XS-Leaks which rely on these objects, pages can forbid or select which origins can embed them. Doing so is possible by using the X-Frame-Options header or the CSP frame-ancestors directive.
Since a website enforcing Framing Protections can&rsquo;t be embedded from an attacker origin, the website is not rendered and the JavaScript does not run. Therefore, none of its subresources (images, JS, or CSS) are retrieved by the browser.

The CSP frame-ancestors directive is the more modern way of enabling framing protections. However, it is not supported by Internet Explorer, so in many cases it is recommended to use it in conjunction with the X-Frame-Options header.

Since cache probing relies on the fact that a browser&rsquo;s HTTP cache is shared across every website, a partitioned HTTP cache can defend against many cache probing techniques. This is done by using tuples (either (top-frame-site, resource-url) like firefox 1 or (top-frame-site, framing-site, resource-url)) like chromium/chrome 2 as the cache keys to ensure the cache is partitioned by the requesting site. This makes it more challenging for attackers to interact with the cached contents of different sites 3 4 5. Safari currently ships a partitioned cache 6.

For browsers that don&rsquo;t use partitioned caches, there are other defenses that applications can deploy to defend against cache probing techniques. Pages can also be designed to require some level of user interaction in order to defend against cache probing attacks.

This mechanism allows applications to force browsers to only include cookies in requests that are issued same-site 1. This type of cookie has three modes: None, Lax, and Strict.
SameSite Cookie Modes # The following SameSite cookie modes are available:
None ‚Äì Disables all protections and restores the old behavior of cookies. This mode is not recommended.

Strict ‚Äì Causes the browser to not include cookies in any cross-site requests. This means &lt;script src=&quot;example.com/resource&quot;&gt;, &lt;img src=&quot;example.com/resource&quot;&gt;, fetch(), and XHR will all make requests without the SameSite Strict cookies attached. Even if the user clicks on a link to example.com/resource, their cookies are not included.
Lax ‚Äì The only difference between Lax and Strict is that Lax mode allows cookies to be added to requests triggered by cross-site top-level navigations. This makes Lax cookies much easier to deploy since they won&rsquo;t break incoming links to your application. Unfortunately, an attacker can trigger a top-level navigation via window.open that allows the attacker to maintain a reference to the window object.
Considerations # Strict cookies provide the strongest security guarantees, but it can be very difficult to deploy Strict same-site cookies in an existing application.
SameSite cookies are neither bulletproof 2 nor can they fix everything. To complement this defense strategy against XS-Leaks, applications should consider implementing other, additional protections. For example, COOP can prevent an attacker from controlling pages using a window reference after the first navigation even if SameSite cookies in Lax mode are used.
important
Some browsers may not use the default of Lax, So explicitly set the SameSite attribute to ensure its enforced. By default, cookies in Chrome without SameSite attribute will default to Lax mode. However, there is an exception for that behavior for cookies set less than 2 minutes ago that are sent via POST requests. 1

The fragment #:~:text= carries a text snippet that is highlighted and brought into the viewport by the browser. This feature can introduce a new XS-Leak if attackers are able to detect when this behavior occurs. This issue is very similar to the Scroll to CSS Selector XS-Leak.
Expected &amp; Discussed Issues # In early discussions regarding the specification of this feature it was shown that several XS-Leaks could be introduced with a na√Øve implementation 1. The specification considers various attack scenarios 2, as does research from Google 3. One possible XS-Leak browsers need to be aware of when implementing this feature is:
An attacker can, by embedding a page as an iframe, detect whether the page scrolled to the text by listening to the onblur event of the parent document. This approach is similar to the ID Attribute XS-Leak. This scenario is mitigated in the Chrome implementation 4, as it only allows fragment navigation to occur in top-level navigations. Current Issues # warning
These XS-Leaks require some type of markup injection on the target page. During the development process of STTF, new attacks and tricks to detect fragment navigation were found. Some of them still work:
A web page that embeds an attacker-controlled iframe might allow the attacker to determine whether a scroll to the text has occurred. This can be done using the IntersectionObserver API 5 2 3. If a page contains images with Lazy Loading, an attacker can detect if fragment navigation that included an image occurred by checking whether the image was cached in the browser. This works because Lazy Loading images are only fetched (and cached) when they appear in the viewport. important
Scroll to Text Fragment is only available in Chrome. Its draft specification is under active discussion. info
Scroll to Text Fragment XS-Leaks allow attackers to extract 1 bit of information at a time, as it&rsquo;s only possible to observe whether a single word exists on the page and only when a user performed some kind of interaction with the page (e.g. a mouse click). Why is this a problem? # Attackers can abuse STTF to leak private information about the user that is displayed on a web page.
Case Scenarios # A user is logged in to their National Health System website, where it is possible to access information about the user&rsquo;s past diseases and health problems. An attacker can lure the user to one of their pages and use STTF to possibly infer the user&rsquo;s health details. For example, an attacker would find out that the victim suffers from a disease if they detect a page scroll when searching for that disease&rsquo;s name.

Attackers can sometimes observe the whole process and mess with the browser, triggering actions that produce side effects on those states.
WebKit ‚Äì ITP # Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) is a privacy feature which is part of WebKit Tracking Prevention technologies. It&rsquo;s a conjunction of several features and aims to prevent a website from tracking a user under a third-party context. Unfortunately, the initial design introduced a new XS-Leak 1, allowing attackers to abuse the states implicitly created by ITP to classify websites as trackers.
Root Cause # To classify whether a website has tracking capabilities, ITP collects statistics on resource loads as well as on user interactions with websites such as clicks, taps, or text entries. Based on the classification of these statistics, ITP gives a strike to a website if it is believed to have tracking capabilities. After 3 strikes, a website is put on a deny list and is treated differently by the browser in future requests.
Issues # One of the issues of ITP is that attackers can manipulate it to arbitrarily enforce certain behaviors. For example, an attacker could force ITP to give a strike to a domain and check if the domain entered the deny list. This information could be leveraged in different ways, for example to:
Leak the user&rsquo;s browsing habits based on how many strikes are necessary for a domain to enter the deny list. Use the deny list to implement an XS-Search attack against a page that includes cross-site resources only when results are present. Fix # To fix the issue, ITP now considers every site to be a &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; site by default, instead of relying on classifications. This removes the implicit states which allowed attackers to detect certain ITP behaviors.

`}),e.add({id:48,href:"/docs/defenses/design-protections/subresource-protections/",title:"Subresource Protections",section:"Application Design",content:`The fundamental idea behind designing protections for subresources is that subresources cannot be targeted by XS-Leaks if the attacker cannot make them return any user data. If implemented correctly, this approach can be a very strong defense, though it is likely to be tough to implement and could negatively impact the user experience.
tip
It can be very effective to deploy this approach on any specific resources that are known to be especially sensitive to XS-Leaks. But, due to the challenges of deploying this protection universally, applications are encouraged to deploy opt-in web platform security features as the default approach. Token-Based Protections # A strong protection for subresources can be achieved by including a user-specific token in every request. This protects against most XS-Leak techniques if implemented correctly. The idea is that in order to verify a request for a resource as being legitimate, a token must be included. This token must be provided to the client in a way that prevents an attacker from including it in their own requests.
example
Suppose there is a search bar in an application.
When the user loads the main page, the server includes a secure token somewhere in the body of the page. When the user searches for something, a request is made to /search?query=&lt;QUERY&gt;&amp;token=&lt;SECURE_TOKEN&gt;. The backend verifies that the provided token is valid for the current user. If it is not valid, the request is rejected. In this scenario, there is no way for an attacker to trigger any requests to the endpoint because they cannot obtain a valid token for a given user. Note that this relies on it not being possible for an attacker to obtain or forge a token for other users. If they can do so, this approach is not effective.
This style of protection can be applied to:
Authenticated subresources such as API endpoints or regular authenticated URLs. While tokens can be used in this case, security mitigations like Same-Site Cookies may be easier to deploy at scale. Unauthenticated subresources such as images can use this protection to prevent some types of Cache Probing Attacks. While this does work, see Cache Protections for other strategies to defend against cache probing attacks. warning
Implementing token-based protections might break the ability of users to save or share links (e.g. bookmarks). User Consent # Another strong defense is to require user interaction before returning any sensitive data. This ensures that sensitive endpoints cannot be included via script or img tags. For example, Facebook requires user confirmation before viewing search results or private messages. Since attackers cannot simulate this user interaction, they are unable to leak the contents of the search results.
This can be a very useful way of protecting especially sensitive endpoints, but note once again that this is likely to be time-consuming to implement.
