One of those mechanisms is SharedArrayBuffer which provides memory sharing between the main thread and a worker thread. A malicious website can create an implicit clock by loading a worker running an infinite loop that increments a number in the buffer. This value can then be accessed by the main thread at any time to read how many incrementations were performed.\n info\nSharedArrayBuffer was removed from browsers with the publication of Spectre. It was reintroduced later in 2020, requiring documents to be in a secure context to make use of the API. Since secure contexts cannot reference any cross-origin content that has not explicitly opted in to being accessed, this means SharedArrayBuffers cannot be used as clocks for some XS-Leaks.\nTo make use of SharedArrayBuffer in modern browsers, an application needs to explicitly opt in to COOP and COEP by setting the following headers:\nCross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp   // Define a function to be ran inside a WebWorker function worker_function() { self.onmessage = function (event) { const sharedBuffer = event.data; const sharedArray = new Uint32Array(sharedBuffer); // Infinitely increase the uint32 number  while (true) Atomics.add(sharedArray, 0, 1); }; } // Create the WebWorker from the JS function and invoke it const worker = new Worker( URL.createObjectURL( new Blob([`(${worker_function})()`], { type: \u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34; })) ); // Create a Shared buffer between the WebWorker and a document const sharedBuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT); const sharedArray = new Uint32Array(sharedBuffer); worker.postMessage(sharedBuffer);   tip\nTo get the relative time in a main thread, you can use the Atomics API.\nAtomics.load(sharedArray, 0);   Other Clocks #  There are a considerable number of APIs attackers can abuse to create implicit clocks: Broadcast Channel API, Message Channel API, requestAnimationFrame, setTimeout, CSS animations, and others 3 4.\nReferences #    Exposing Private Information by Timing Web Applications, link \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Shared memory: Side-channel information leaks, link \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Fantastic Timers and Where to Find Them: High-Resolution Microarchitectural Attacks in JavaScript, link \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Trusted Browsers for Uncertain Times, link \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "}),a.add({id:3,href:'/docs/attacks/xs-search/',title:"XS-Search",section:"Attacks",content:"Cross-site search (XS-Search) is an important attack principle in the family of XS-Leaks. This type of attack abuses Query-Based Search Systems to leak user information from an attacker origin 1 2. The original attack uses timing measurements to detect whether or not a search system returns results and works as follows:\n Establish a baseline of the time needed for a request to return results (hit), and a baseline for the time needed by a request with no results (miss). Start a timing attack on the request to the search endpoint, brute-forcing the first character (?q=r). If the measurement is under the hit baseline, then add one more character (?q=ra); otherwise try a new one (?q=s). In the end, a full secret (?q=secret) can be leaked.  This attack requires multiple timing measurements to be accurate, something which can be improved with inflation techniques and statistical analysis. Furthermore, instead of brute-forcing letter by letter, attackers can search specific words or sentences to leak only the occurrence of results.\nThe most important part of this attack is its principle, as it can be applied to a number of different XS-Leaks.\nInflation Techniques #  The inflation techniques of XS-Search are used to increase the accuracy of the attack to make the two response types (hit or miss) easier to distinguish. The following two mechanisms allow attackers to make better measurements:\n If a search system reflects certain GET parameters into the response when returning results, the size of the response increases. This makes the request more distinguishable because the time to prepare the response and send it over the network grows substantially. Force the server to perform more computation work before returning a response. This approach can be applied in search systems offering more expressive query languages (e.g. exclude terms in Gmail needs to process every character in the results).  Extended Principle #  While the original research around XS-Search focused on timing attacks, the principle of the attack extends to other XS-Leaks. Instead of relying on timing measurements, which are unreliable, attackers can use other XS-Leaks to extract the same information.\nIn a Query-Based Search System, a user submits queries and gets responses associated with those queries. This action can result in two different outcomes:\n The system shows results and the page behaves in a specific way (first state). The system does not show results and the page behaves in a different way than in step 1 (second state).  If both behaviors above can be distinguished by a more reliable XS-Leak than timing, then an attacker could perform a more efficient XS-Search attack. For example, if the number of frames on a page varies based on search results (step 1 and 2 are distinguishable), this attack principle can be applied with a Frame Counting XS-Leak which could be more accurate than one using timing measurements.\nDefense #     Attack Alternative SameSite Cookies (Lax) COOP Framing Protections Isolation Policies     XS-Search (timing) ✔️ ❌ ❌ RIP 🔗 NIP    🔗 – Defense mechanisms must be combined to be effective against different scenarios.\nReferences #    Cross-Site Search Attacks, link \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Cross-Site Search (XS-Search) Attacks - Hemi Leibowitz, OWASP AppSec IL 2015, link \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "}),a.add({id:5,href:'/docs/defenses/opt-in/',title:"Opt-In Mechanisms",section:"Defense Mechanisms",content:"Opt-In Mechanisms #  There are many different opt-in mechanisms that applications can deploy to defend against XS-Leaks.

Unfortunately, blocking certain types of requests introduced a new type of XS-Leaks 1 that allows attackers to detect if CORB was enforced on one request, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t on another. Nevertheless, the introduced XS-Leaks are much less problematic than the issues actively protected by CORB (e.g. Spectre).\n info\nThis is a known issue in Chromium, and while it might remain unfixed, its impact is greatly reduced by the rollout of SameSite Cookies by default in Chromium-based browsers.  CORB \u0026amp; Error Events #  Attackers can observe when CORB is enforced if a response returns a CORB protected Content-Type (and nosniff) with the status code 2xx which results in CORB stripping the body and headers from the response. Detecting this protection allows an attacker to leak the combination of both the status code (success vs. error) and the Content-Type (protected by CORB or not). This allows the distinction of two possible states as shown in these examples:\n One state results in a request being protected by CORB and the second state in a client error (404). One state is protected by CORB and the second state is not.  The following steps allow abusing this protection in the context of the first example:\n An attacker can embed a cross-origin resource in a script tag which returns 200 OK with text/html as Content-Type and a nosniff Header. To protect sensitive contents from entering the attacker\u0026rsquo;s process, CORB will replace the original response with an empty one. Since an empty response is valid JavaScript, the onerror event won\u0026rsquo;t be fired, onload will fire instead. The attacker triggers a second request (corresponding to a second state), similar to 1., which returns something other than 200 OK. The onerror event will fire.  The interesting behavior is that CORB creates a valid resource out of the request which could contain something other than JavaScript (causing an error). Considering a non-CORB environment, both 1. and 4. requests would trigger an error. This introduces an XS-Leak as these situations are now distinguishable.\nDetecting the nosniff Header #  CORB can also allow attackers to detect when the nosniff header is present in the request. This problem originated due to the fact that CORB is only enforced depending on the presence of this header and some sniffing algorithms. The example below shows two distinguishable states:\n CORB will prevent an attacker page which embeds a resource as a script if the resource is served with text/html as Content-Type along with the nosniff header. If the resource does not set nosniff and CORB fails to infer the Content-Type of the page (which remains text/html), a SyntaxError will be fired since the contents can\u0026rsquo;t be parsed as valid JavaScript. This error can be caught by listening to window.onerror as script tags only trigger error events under certain conditions.

When a response has an error status, an error event is fired by the browser for the page to handle. These errors also cover situations where the parser fails, for example when trying to embed HTML content as an image.\nFor example, attackers can detect whether a user is logged in to a service by checking if the user has access to resources only available to authenticated users 1.

If a page load causes a download, it does not trigger a navigation and the window stays within the same origin.\nThe following snippet can be used to detect whether such a navigation has occurred and therefore detect a download attempt:\n// Set the destination URL to test for the download attempt var url = \u0026#39;https://example.org/\u0026#39;; // Create an outer iframe to measure onload event var iframe = document.createElement(\u0026#39;iframe\u0026#39;); document.body.appendChild(iframe); // Create an inner iframe to test for the download attempt iframe.srcdoc = `\u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;${url}\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;`; iframe.onload = () =\u0026gt; { try { // If a navigation occurs, the iframe will be cross-origin,  // so accessing \u0026#34;inner.origin\u0026#34; will throw an exception  iframe.contentWindow.frames[0].origin; console.log(\u0026#39;Download attempt detected\u0026#39;); } catch(e) { console.log(\u0026#39;No download attempt detected\u0026#39;); } }   info\nWhen there is no navigation inside an iframe caused by a download attempt, the iframe does not trigger an onload event directly. For this reason, in the example above, an outer iframe was used instead, which listens for an onload event which triggers when subresources finish loading, including iframes.   important\nThis attack works regardless of any Framing Protections, because the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy headers are ignored if Content-Disposition: attachment is specified.  Download Navigation (without iframes) #  A variation of the technique presented in the previous section can also be effectively tested using window objects:\n// Set the destination URL var url = \u0026#39;https://example.org\u0026#39;; // Get a window reference var win = window.open(url); // Wait for the window to load. setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { try { // If a navigation occurs, the iframe will be cross-origin,  // so accessing \u0026#34;win.origin\u0026#34; will throw an exception  win.origin; parent.console.log(\u0026#39;Download attempt detected\u0026#39;); } catch(e) { parent.console.log(\u0026#39;No download attempt detected\u0026#39;); } }, 2000); Server-Side Redirects #  Inflation #  A server-side redirect can be detected from a cross-origin page if the destination URL increases in size and contains an attacker-controlled input (either in the form of a query string parameter or a path). The following technique relies on the fact that it is possible to induce an error in most web-servers by generating large request parameters/paths. Since the redirect increases the size of the URL, it can be detected by sending exactly one character less than the server\u0026rsquo;s maximum capacity. That way, if the size increases, the server will respond with an error that can be detected from a cross-origin page (e.g. via Error Events).\n example\nAn example of this attack can be seen here.  Cross-Origin Redirects #  CSP Violations #  Content-Security-Policy (CSP) is an in-depth defense mechanism against XSS and data injection attacks. When a CSP is violated, a SecurityPolicyViolationEvent is thrown. An attacker can set up a CSP which triggers a Violation event every time a fetch follows an URL not set in the CSP directive. This allows an attacker to detect if a redirect to another origin occurred 1 2.\nThe example below triggers a SecurityPolicyViolationEvent if the website set in the fetch API (line 6) redirects to a website other than target.page:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  \u0026lt;!-- Set the Content-Security-Policy to only allow example.org --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta http-equiv=\u0026#34;Content-Security-Policy\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;connect-src https://example.org\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; // Listen for a CSP violation event document.addEventListener(\u0026#39;securitypolicyviolation\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Detected a redirect to somewhere other than example.org\u0026#34;); }); // Try to fetch example.org.

If this is only done for a specific group of users, it becomes possible for an attacker to leak the \u0026ldquo;client status\u0026rdquo; of the user.\nDefense #     Attack Alternative SameSite Cookies (Lax) COOP Framing Protections Isolation Policies     history.length (iframes) ✔️ ❌ ✔️ FIP   history.length (windows) ❌ ✔️ ❌ NIP   onload event inside an iframe ✔️ ❌ ✔️ FIP   Download bar ✔️ ❌ ❌   \\(^{1}\\)   NIP   Download Navigation (iframes) ✔️ ❌ ❌ \\(^{1}\\)   FIP   Download Navigation (windows) ❌ ❌ \\(^{1}\\)   ❌ NIP   Inflation ✔️ ❌ ❌ RIP   CSP Violations ✔️ ❌ ❌ RIP 🔗 NIP    🔗 – Defense mechanisms must be combined to be effective against different scenarios.\n  Neither COOP nor Framing Protections helps with the mitigation of the redirect leaks because when the header Content-Disposition is present, other headers are being ignored.

These attacks have had different levels of impact over time, gaining new attention when browsers started shipping high-precision timers like performance.now().\nTo obtain timing measurements, attackers must use a clock, either an implicit or an explicit one. These clocks are usually interchangeable for the purposes of XS-Leaks and only vary in accuracy and availability. For simplicity, this article assumes the use of the performance.now() API, an explicit clock present in all modern browsers.\nThis side-channel allows attackers to infer information from a cross-site request based on how much time it takes to complete that request 3. The network timing measurement may vary based on the user state and it\u0026rsquo;s usually connected to the:\n Resource size. Computation time in the backend. Number and size of sub-resources. Cache status.   tip\nLearn more about the different types of clocks in the Clocks article.  Modern Web Timing Attacks #  The performance.now() API can be used to measure how much time it takes to perform a request:\n// Start the clock var start = performance.now() // Measure how long it takes to complete the fetch requests fetch(\u0026#39;https://example.org\u0026#39;, { mode: \u0026#39;no-cors\u0026#39;, credentials: \u0026#39;include\u0026#39; }).then(() =\u0026gt; { // When fetch finishes, calculate the difference  var time = performance.now() - start; console.log(\u0026#34;The request took %d ms.\u0026#34;, time); }); Onload events #  A similar process can be used to measure how long it takes to fetch a resource by simply watching for an onload event:\n// Create a script element pointing to the page we want to time var script = document.createElement(\u0026#39;script\u0026#39;); script.src = \u0026#34;https://example.org\u0026#34;; document.body.appendChild(script); // Start the clock var start = performance.now(); // When script loads, caculate the time it took to finish the request script.onload = () =\u0026gt; { var time = performance.now() - start; console.log(\u0026#34;The request took %d ms.\u0026#34;, time) }   tip\nA similar technique can be used for other HTML elements, e.g. \u0026lt;img\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;link\u0026gt;, or \u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;, which could be used in scenarios where other techniques fail. For example, if Fetch Metadata blocks loading a resource into a script tag, it may allow loading it into an image tag.   tip\nAn alternative way could be to use image.complete property. More information here.  Cross-window Timing Attacks #  An attacker can also measure the network timing of a page by opening a new window with window.open and waiting for the window to start loading. The snippet below shows how to make this measurement:\n// Open a new window to measure when the iframe starts loading var win = window.open(\u0026#39;https://example.org\u0026#39;); // Measure the initial time var start = performance.now(); // Define the loop function measure(){ try{ // If the page has loaded, then it will be on a different origin  // so `win.origin` will throw an exception  win.origin; // If the window is still same-origin, immediately repeat the loop but  // without blocking the event loop  setTimeout(measure, 0); }catch(e){ // Once the window has loaded, calculate the time difference  var time = performance.now() - start; console.log(\u0026#39;It took %d ms to load the window\u0026#39;, time); } } // Initiate the loop that breaks when the window switches origins measure();   note\nNote that this POC uses setTimeout in order to create the rough equivalent of a while(true) loop. It is necessary to implement it in this way in order to avoid blocking the JS event loop.   tip\nThis technique can also be adapted to measure the Execution Timing of a page by making the event loop busy.  Unload events #  The unload and beforeunload events can be used to measure the time it takes to fetch a resource. This works because beforeunload is triggered when the browser requests a new navigation request, while unload is triggered when that navigation actually occurs. Because of this behaviour, it is possible to calculate the time difference between these two events and measure the time it took the browser to complete fetching the resource.\n info\nThe time difference between unload and beforeunload is not affected by the x-frame-options (XFO) header, because the event is triggered before the browser learns about the response headers.  The below snippet makes use of the SharedArrayBuffer clock which needs to be initiated before the snippet is ran:\n// Create a Shared buffer to be used by a WebWorker var sharedBuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT); var sharedArray = new Uint32Array(sharedBuffer); // Follow the steps of initiating the WebWorker and then call worker.postMessage(sharedBuffer); var start; iframe.contentWindow.onbeforeunload = () =\u0026gt; { // Get the \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; during the navigation  start = Atomics.load(sharedArray, 0); } iframe.contentWindow.onpagehide = () =\u0026gt; { // Get the \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; after the navigation  var end = Atomics.load(sharedArray, 0); console.log(\u0026#39;The difference between events was %d iterations\u0026#39;, end - start); };   tip\nThe SharedArrayBuffer clock was used to create a high-resolution timer. However, the time difference between the beforeunload and unload events of iframes can be measured with other clocks as well, e.g. performance.now().   tip\nThe presented snippet makes use of iframes to make the measurement. A variation of this attack can also use window references, which is harder to protect against.  Sandboxed Frame Timing Attacks #  If a page doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any Framing Protections implemented, an attacker can time how long it takes for the page and all subresources to load over the network. By default, the onload handler for an iframe is invoked after all the resources have been loaded and all JavaScript has finished executing. But, an attacker can eliminate the noise of script execution by including the sandbox attribute in the \u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;. This attribute blocks a lot of features including JavaScript execution, which results in almost pure network measurement.\nvar iframe = document.createElement(\u0026#39;iframe\u0026#39;); // Set the URL of the destination website iframe.src = \u0026#34;https://example.org\u0026#34;; // Set sandbox attribute to block script execution iframe.sandbox = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; document.body.appendChild(iframe); // Measure the time before the request was initiated var start = performance.now(); iframe.onload = () =\u0026gt; { // When iframe loads, calculate the time difference  var time = performance.now() - start; console.log(\u0026#34;The iframe and subresources took %d ms to load.\u0026#34;, time) } Timeless Timing Attacks #  Other types of attacks do not consider the notion of time to perform a timing attack 4. Timeless attacks consist of fitting two HTTP requests (the baseline and the attacked request) in a single packet, to guarantee they arrive to the server at the same time. The server will process the requests concurrently, and return a response based on their execution time as soon as possible. One of the two requests will arrive first, allowing the attacker to infer the time difference by comparing the order in which the requests arrived.\nThe advantage of this technique is the independence from network jitter and uncertain delays, something that is always present in the remaining techniques.\n important\nThis attack is limited to specific versions of HTTP and joint scenarios. It makes certain assumptions and has requirements regarding server behavior.

The concept has been known since the beginning of the web 1 and initially relied on detecting timing differences.\nWhen a user visits a website, some resources such as images, scripts, and HTML content are fetched and later cached by the browser (under certain conditions). This optimization makes future navigations faster as the browser serves those resources from disk instead of requesting them again. If an attacker can detect which resources are cached, this information can be enough to leak whether a user accessed a specific page in the past.\nA variation of Cache Probing abuses Error Events to perform more accurate and impactful attacks.\nAttack Principle #  An attacker wants to know whether a user visited a certain social network:\n When the user visits the social network some of the subresources are cached. The user visits an attacker-controlled page which fetches a resource that is usually fetched by the social network. Using a Network Timing XS-Leak, the attacker page can detect the difference between a response coming from the cache (i.e. step 1 occurred) or coming from the network (i.e. step 1 did not occur): the delay is significantly lower if a request is served from the cache.  Cache Probing with Error Events #  Cache Probing with Error Events 2 allows more accurate attacks. Instead of relying on timing measurements, this approach leverages Error Events and some server-side behavior to detect whether a resource was cached. The attack requires the following steps:\n Invalidating the resource from the browser cache. This step is required to make sure the attack does not consider a resource previously cached in another visit. Performing a request that causes different items to be cached depending on the user\u0026rsquo;s state. For example, loading a page that includes a specific image only if the user is logged in. This request can be triggered by navigating to the target website with \u0026lt;link rel=prerender.., embedding the website in an iframe, or opening a new window with window.open. Triggering a request that causes the server to reject the request. For example, including an overlong referer header that makes the server reject the request. If the resource was cached in step 2, this request succeeds instead of triggering an error event.  Invalidating the cache #  To invalidate a resource from the cache, the attacker must force the server to return an error when fetching that subresource. There are a couple of ways to achieve this:\n A fetch request with a cache:'reload'option that is aborted with AbortController.abort() before new content has been received, but after the request was initiated by the browser. A request with an overlong referer header and 'cache':'reload'. This might not work as browsers capped the length of the referrer to prevent this. A POST request with a fetch no-cors. Sometimes, even in cases where an error is not returned, the browser invalidates the cache. Request headers such as Content-Type, Accept, Accept-Language, etc. that may cause the server to fail (more application dependent). Other request properties.  Often, some of these methods might be considered a bug in the browser (e.g. this bug).\nCORS error on Origin Reflection misconfiguration #  Origin reflection is a behavior in which a globally accessible resource is provided with a Access-Control-Allow-Orign (ACAO) header whose value reflects the origin that initialized the request. This can be considered as CORS misconfiguration 3 and can be used to detect whether the resource exists in the browser cache.\n info\nFor example, Flask framework promotes origin reflection as the default behavior.  If a resource hosted on server.com is requested from target.com then the origin could be reflected in the response headers as: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: target.com. If the resource is cached, this information is stored together with the resource in the browser cache. With that, if attacker.com tries to fetch the same resource there are two possible scenarios:\n The resource is not in cache: the resource could be fetched and stored together with the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: attacker.com header. The resource was already in cache: fetch attempt will try to fetch the resource from the cache but it will also generate a CORS error due to the ACAO header value mismatch with the requesting origin (target.com origin was expected but attacker.com was provided). Here below is provided an example code snippet epxloting this vulnerability to infer the cache status of the victim\u0026rsquo;s browser.  // The function simply take a url and fetch it in CORS mode // if the fetch raises an error, it will be a CORS error due to the // origin mismatch between attacker.com and victim\u0026#39;s ip function checkCachedResource(url) { fetch(url, { mode: \u0026#34;cors\u0026#34; }).catch((e) =\u0026gt; { return true }); return false } // This makes sense only if the attacker alredy knows that // server.com suffers from origin reflection CORS misconfiguration var resource_url = \u0026#34;server.com/reflected_origin_resource.html\u0026#34; verdict = checkCachedResource(resource_url) console.log(\u0026#34;Resource was cached: \u0026#34; + verdict)   tip\nThe best way to mitigate this is to avoid origin reflection and use the header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * for globally accessible and unauthenticated resources.  Fetch with AbortController #  The below snippet shows how the AbortController interface could be combined with fetch and setTimeout to both detect whether the resource is cached and to evict a specific resource from the browser cache. A nice feature of this technique is that the probing occurs without caching new content in the process.\nasync function ifCached(url, purge = false) { var controller = new AbortController(); var signal = controller.signal; // After 9ms, abort the request (before the request was finished).  // The timeout might need to be adjusted for the attack to work properly.  // Purging content seems to take slightly less time than probing  var wait_time = (purge) ? 3 : 9; var timeout = await setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { controller.abort(); }, wait_time); try { // credentials option is needed for Firefox  let options = { mode: \u0026#34;no-cors\u0026#34;, credentials: \u0026#34;include\u0026#34;, signal: signal }; // If the option \u0026#34;cache: reload\u0026#34; is set, the browser will purge  // the resource from the browser cache  if(purge) options.cache = \u0026#34;reload\u0026#34;; await fetch(url, options); } catch (err) { // When controller.abort() is called, the fetch will throw an Exception  if(purge) console.log(\u0026#34;The resource was purged from the cache\u0026#34;); else console.log(\u0026#34;The resource is not cached\u0026#34;); return false } // clearTimeout will only be called if this line was reached in less than  // wait_time which means that the resource must have arrived from the cache  clearTimeout(timeout); console.log(\u0026#34;The resource is cached\u0026#34;); return true; } // purge https://example.org from the cache await ifCached(\u0026#39;https://example.org\u0026#39;, true); // Put https://example.org into the cache // Skip this step to simulate a case where example.org is not cached open(\u0026#39;https://example.org\u0026#39;); // wait 1 second (until example.org loads) await new Promise(resolve =\u0026gt; setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Check if https://example.org is in the cache await ifCached(\u0026#39;https://example.org\u0026#39;); Defense #  Currently, there are no good defense mechanisms that would allow websites to fully protect against Cache Probing attacks. Nonetheless, a website can mitigate the attack surface by deploying Cache Protections such as:\n Cache-control headers used to prevent the resource from caching. Random Tokens used to make the URLs unpredictable for attackers. Vary: Sec-Fetch-Site used to segregate the cache by a group of origins.  A promising defense against Cache Probing attacks is partitioning the HTTP cache by the requesting origin. This browser-provided protection prevents an attacker\u0026rsquo;s origin from interfering with cached resources of other origins.\n important\nAs of November 2020, Partitioned Caches are not available in most browsers, so applications cannot rely on them.

If, for example, some time-consuming task blocks the event loop, the user can perceive a freeze on a page as a result of the UI thread being starved. Other tasks must wait until the blocking task finishes. Each browser implements different process models, which means some web sites might run in different threads (and event loops) depending on their relations.\nSome techniques can exploit this model to steal secrets from a cross-origin page:\n Inferring how long code from a different origin takes to run by measuring how long it takes to run next in the event pool 1 2. The attacker keeps sending events to the event loop with fixed properties, which will eventually be dispatched if the pool is empty. Other origins dispatch events to the same pool, and this is where an attacker infers the time difference by detecting if a delay occurred with one of its tasks. Stealing a secret from a cross-origin page if the said secret is being compared by an attacker-controlled string. The leak is a result of comparing time differences in the event loop of a char-by-char string comparison 2 (using the previous technique). In browsers without process isolation, cross-window communications between different origins run in the same thread, thus sharing the same event loop.   important\nThe latter attack is no longer possible in browsers with process isolation mechanisms in place. Such mechanisms are currently only present in Chromium-based browsers with Site Isolation; they are coming to Firefox soon under the name Project Fission.  Busy Event Loop #  Another technique used to measure JavaScript execution consists of blocking the event loop of a thread and timing how long it takes for the event loop to become available again. One of the main advantages of this technique is its ability to circumvent Site Isolation, as an attacker origin can influence the execution of another origin. The attack works as follows:\n Navigate the target website in a separate window with window.open or inside an iframe (if Framing Protections are not in place). Wait for the long computation to start. Load any same-site page inside an iframe, regardless of any Framing Protections.  An attacker can detect how long the target website is executed by timing how long it took for the iframe (in step 3) to trigger the onload event (Network Timing of step 3 should be minimal). Since both navigations occurred within the same context and they are same-site, they run in the same thread and share the same event loop (they can block each other).\n// Open a new window to measure how long the window blocks the event loop // for the site example.org window.open(\u0026#39;https://example.org/expensive\u0026#39;); // TODO: Wait for the expensive window to load, e.g. via timeout // then create an iframe to the same site var ifr = document.createElement(\u0026#39;iframe\u0026#39;); ifr.src = \u0026#34;https://example.org\u0026#34;; document.body.appendChild(ifr); // Measure the initial time var start = performance.now(); ifr.onload = () =\u0026gt; { // When the iframe loads calculate the time difference  var time = performance.now() - start; console.log(\u0026#39;It took %d ms to load the window\u0026#39;, time); } Service Workers #  Service Workers can be used to offer offline solutions to web applications, but they can be abused by attackers to measure the timing of JavaScript execution3. They serve as a proxy between the browser and the network and allow applications to intercept any network requests made by the main thread (document).\nTo make a timing measurement, an attacker can perform the following steps:\n The attacker registers a service worker in one of their domains (attacker.com). In the main document, the attacker issues a navigation (window.open) to the target website and instructs the Service Worker to start a timer. When the new window starts loading, the attacker navigates the reference obtained in step 2 to a page handled by the Service Worker. When the request performed in step 3 arrives at the service worker, it returns a 204 (No Content) response, which aborts the navigation. At this point, the Service Worker collects a measurement from the timer started in step 2. This measurement is affected by how long JavaScript blocked the navigation.  Since no navigation actually occurs, steps 3 to 5 can be repeated to obtain more measurements on successive JavaScript execution timings.\nCSS Injections #   warning\nThis group of XS-Leaks requires a CSS injection on the target page.  Among the different CSS injection vectors, the most noticeable one is the abuse of CSS Selectors. They can be used as an expression to match and select certain HTML elements. For example, the selector input[value^=\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;] is matched if the value of an input tag starts with the character \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo;. So, to detect if a CSS Selector matches the expression, attackers can trigger a callback to one of their websites using certain properties like background, @import, etc. 4 5. The matching process can easily be brute-forced, and extended to the full string.\njQuery, CSS Selectors \u0026amp; Short-circuit Timing #  Attackers can abuse another interesting behavior of CSS selectors which is short-circuit evaluation of expressions. This expression is received in a URL hash and evaluated if the page executes jQuery(location.hash) 6.\nA timing attack is possible because the expression is compared from right to left, so if the selector main[id='site-main'] does not match and fails to evaluate, the other parts of the selector (*:has(*:has(*:has(*))))), which take longer to execute, are ignored (just like the and operator, but backwards).\n$(\u0026#34;*:has(*:has(*:has(*)) *:has(*:has(*:has(*))) *:has(*:has(*:has(*)))) main[id=\u0026#39;site-main\u0026#39;]\u0026#34;)   tip\nIn browsers with process isolation mechanisms, Service Workers can be abused to obtain the execution timing measurement or tricks like Busy Event Loop tricks can be used to circumvent Site Isolation.  ReDoS #   warning\nThis group of XS-Leaks requires an injection of Regex Expressions on the target page.  Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a technique which results in a Denial of Service in applications that allow regex as user input 2 7. Maliciously crafted regular expressions can be made to run in exponential time. This can be used as an XS-Leak vector if a regex can be injected that has a different runtime depending on the data on the page.

This means that Network Timing might be more significant for pages with more backend processing, while Execution Timing can be more significant in applications processing and displaying data within the browser. Attackers can also eliminate some of these factors to obtain more precise measurements.

The bank used the OTP as the id of a button that is used to show the PIN to the client. This approach could be abused to steal these OTP codes by brute-forcing every option and then using them to compromise user accounts.

Google and many other companies believe that the right approach to fixing XS-Leaks is to invest time and engineering power into new large scale mitigations and changes to the web platform that applications can use to mitigate entire categories of XS-Leaks.\nBrowsers now provide a number of useful opt-in mechanisms that can be used to mitigate XS-Leaks. While these provide strong protections, the disadvantage is that they are not yet well supported by every browser. Defending against XS-Leaks effectively requires a mixture of different techniques, each of which is described in detail below.\nOpt-in Mechanisms #  These defense mechanisms allow applications to address classes of similar XS-Leaks at the same time. These protections can either allow applications to change the behavior of the browser or provide additional information that applications can use to change their own behavior.\n tip\nDeploying a combination of opt-in defense mechanisms should be the default strategy. Not only do they protect against XS-Leaks, but also against other vulnerabilities such as XSSI, Clickjacking, CSRF, etc.   important\nWhen using any mitigations that rely on browser support, be sure to check that they are well supported by your customers' browsers. For example, fetch metadata headers are a great tool, but are currently only supported in Chromium-based browsers. Check MDN for up-to-date information on browser support for different standards.  Application Design #  Application design techniques are focused on carefully designing the application in a way that prevents XS-Leaks.

The other big advantage is that careful application design can stop XS-Leaks even on older browsers that don\u0026rsquo;t support the newest browser standards.\n note\nIt is very difficult to use application design techniques to block every XS-Leak technique across an entire application. While application design techniques are effective at stopping severe leaks, opt-in mechanisms provided by the browser are a better overall solution.

This can be very effective against cross-origin attacks like XSSI, XS-Leaks, Clickjacking, and CSRF if a strict policy is deployed on the server.\nIn the XS-Leaks scenario, servers have the ability to know when a request was made cross-origin (e.g. attacker origin) and can return a different response with no user data.

These approaches are explained in the following sections.\nCache Protection via Cache-Control Headers #  If it is acceptable to disable caching, doing so provides a strong defense against cache probing attacks. Disabling caching means that every time someone loads a resource, the resource has to be fetched again. To disable caching, set a Cache-Control: no-store header on every single response that you wish to protect.\nAdvantages:\n Supported by all major browsers  Disadvantages:\n Negatively impacts site performance  Cache Protection via Random Tokens #  Rather than disabling caching, applications can include additional data in URLs in order to defend against cache probing attacks. This can be achieved by including a random token in the URL of every subresource that you reference. If an attacker cannot guess this random token, then the attacker cannot determine whether items are in the cache via any straightforward techniques.\n example\nSuppose that every page on your application loads the user\u0026rsquo;s profile photo: /user/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.png. An attacker could check which user is signed in by probing the cache for /user/john.png, /user/jane.png, and so on.\nThis is where a random token can come into play. If implemented, the application takes the user\u0026rsquo;s profile photo from /user/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.png?cache_buster=\u0026lt;RANDOM_TOKEN\u0026gt; on every load. The server does not need to do anything with this random token. It is there purely to ensure that there is no way for an attacker to probe the cache without knowing the random token.\n If implemented carefully, an application could even have a user-specific random token that is reused across page loads. This would allow subresources to still be cached since the URL would remain constant for a given user.\nAdvantages:\n Supported by every major browser Does not break caching  Disadvantages:\n Difficult to implement  Cache Protection via Fetch Metadata #  Fetch-Metadata is meant to allow servers to determine how and why a request was initiated on the client side. One piece of information that is exposed is the Sec-Fetch-Site header which specifies whether a request is coming from the same origin or a different origin. This can be combined with the Vary header in order to force the browser to segment the cache based on whether a request is made from the same origin or a different origin.\nThis is done by setting Vary: Sec-Fetch-Site on all resources you wish to protect.\n example\nAssume we have the resource cdn.example.com/image.png that we wish to protect from cache probing attacks. If we set Vary: Sec-Fetch-Site on it, this leads to the following behavior:\n If example.com tries to load the resource, the request is initiated by the same site so it is cached under (SFS: same-site, resource_url) If cdn.example.com tries to load the resource, the request is initiated by the same origin so it is cached under (SFS: same-origin, resource_url) If evil.com tries to load the resource, the request is initiated by a different site so it is cached under (SFS: cross-site, resource_url)  Note that this means cross-site requests are separated from same-site and same-origin requests.\n Advantages:\n Does not break caching  Disadvantages:\n Fetch metadata is a new standard that is currently only supported in Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Chrome and Edge) Cross-site subresources loaded on the page are not protected (e.g. subresources from CDNs) If third parties load the resource, they are not protected  "}),a.add({id:33,href:'/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/connection-pool/',title:"Connection Pool",section:"Timing Attacks",content:"Another way to measure the network timing of a request consists of abusing the socket pool of a browser 1.

Block   \\(255\\)  sockets for a long period of time by performing  \\(255\\)  requests to different hosts that simply hang the connection Use the  \\(256^{th}\\)  socket by performing a request to the target page. Perform a  \\(257^{th}\\)  request to another host. Since all the sockets are being used (in steps 2 and 3), this request must wait until the pool receives an available socket. This waiting period provides the attacker with the network timing of the  \\(256^{th}\\)  socket, which belongs to the target page. This works because the  \\(255\\)  sockets in step 2 are still blocked, so if the pool received an available socket, it was caused by the release of the socket in step 3.

This approach is similar to the ID Attribute XS-Leak. This scenario is mitigated in the Chrome implementation 4, as it only allows fragment navigation to occur in top-level navigations.  Current Issues #   warning\nThese XS-Leaks require some type of markup injection on the target page.  During the development process of STTF, new attacks and tricks to detect fragment navigation were found. Some of them still work:\n A web page that embeds an attacker-controlled iframe might allow the attacker to determine whether a scroll to the text has occurred. This can be done using the IntersectionObserver API 5 2 3. If a page contains images with Lazy Loading, an attacker can detect if fragment navigation that included an image occurred by checking whether the image was cached in the browser. This works because Lazy Loading images are only fetched (and cached) when they appear in the viewport.   important\nScroll to Text Fragment is only available in Chrome.

Why is this a problem? #  Attackers can abuse STTF to leak private information about the user that is displayed on a web page.\nCase Scenarios #  A user is logged in to their National Health System website, where it is possible to access information about the user\u0026rsquo;s past diseases and health problems.

Unfortunately, the initial design introduced a new XS-Leak 1, allowing attackers to abuse the states implicitly created by ITP to classify websites as trackers.\nRoot Cause #  To classify whether a website has tracking capabilities, ITP collects statistics on resource loads as well as on user interactions with websites such as clicks, taps, or text entries. Based on the classification of these statistics, ITP gives a strike to a website if it is believed to have tracking capabilities.

If implemented correctly, this approach can be a very strong defense, though it is likely to be tough to implement and could negatively impact the user experience.\n tip\nIt can be very effective to deploy this approach on any specific resources that are known to be especially sensitive to XS-Leaks. But, due to the challenges of deploying this protection universally, applications are encouraged to deploy opt-in web platform security features as the default approach.  Token-Based Protections #  A strong protection for subresources can be achieved by including a user-specific token in every request. This protects against most XS-Leak techniques if implemented correctly. The idea is that in order to verify a request for a resource as being legitimate, a token must be included. This token must be provided to the client in a way that prevents an attacker from including it in their own requests.\n example\nSuppose there is a search bar in an application.\n When the user loads the main page, the server includes a secure token somewhere in the body of the page. When the user searches for something, a request is made to /search?query=\u0026lt;QUERY\u0026gt;\u0026amp;token=\u0026lt;SECURE_TOKEN\u0026gt;. The backend verifies that the provided token is valid for the current user. If it is not valid, the request is rejected.  In this scenario, there is no way for an attacker to trigger any requests to the endpoint because they cannot obtain a valid token for a given user. Note that this relies on it not being possible for an attacker to obtain or forge a token for other users. If they can do so, this approach is not effective.\n This style of protection can be applied to:\n Authenticated subresources such as API endpoints or regular authenticated URLs. While tokens can be used in this case, security mitigations like Same-Site Cookies may be easier to deploy at scale. Unauthenticated subresources such as images can use this protection to prevent some types of Cache Probing Attacks. While this does work, see Cache Protections for other strategies to defend against cache probing attacks.   warning\nImplementing token-based protections might break the ability of users to save or share links (e.g. bookmarks).  User Consent #  Another strong defense is to require user interaction before returning any sensitive data. This ensures that sensitive endpoints cannot be included via script or img tags. For example, Facebook requires user confirmation before viewing search results or private messages. Since attackers cannot simulate this user interaction, they are unable to leak the contents of the search results.\nThis can be a very useful way of protecting especially sensitive endpoints, but note once again that this is likely to be time-consuming to implement.\n"})})()
