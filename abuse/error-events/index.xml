Unfortunately, blocking certain types of requests introduced a new type of XS-Leaks that allows attackers to detect if CORB was enforced on one request, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t on another. Nevertheless, the introduced XS-Leaks are much less problematic than the issues actively protected by CORB (e.g Spectre).
info
This issue is known to Chromium, and while it might remain unfixed, its impact is highly reduced by the rollout of Same-Site Cookies by default in Chromium-based browsers.</description></item><item><title>Error Events</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/error-events/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/error-events/</guid><description>When a webpage issues a request to a server (e.g. fetch, HTML tags), the server receives and processes this request. When received, the server decides whether the request should succeed (e.g. 200) or fail (e.g. 404) based on the provided context. When a response has an error status, an error event is fired by the browser for the page to handle. These errors also cover situations where the parser fails, for example when trying to embed HTML content as an image.</description></item><item><title>Cache Probing</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/cache-probing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/cache-probing/</guid><description>The principle of Cache Probing consists of detecting whether some resource was cached by the browser. The concept is known since the beginning of the web 1 and initially relied on detecting timing differences.
When a user visits a website some resources such as images, scripts, and HTML content are fetched and later cached by the browser (under certain conditions). This optimization will make future navigations faster as the browser will serve those resources from disk instead of requesting them again.</description></item></channel></rss>
