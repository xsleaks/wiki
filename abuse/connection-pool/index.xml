Browsers use sockets to communicate with servers. As the operating system and the hardware it runs on have limited resources, browsers have to impose a limit.
To exploit the existence of this limit, attackers can:
Check what the limit of the browser is, for example 256 global sockets. Block \(255\) sockets for a long period of time by performing \(255\) requests to different hosts that simply hang the connection Use the \(256^{th}\) socket by performing a request to the target page.</description></item></channel></rss>
