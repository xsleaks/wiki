Unfortunately, blocking certain types of requests introduced a new type of XS-Leaks 1 that allows attackers to detect if CORB was enforced on one request, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t on another. Nevertheless, the introduced XS-Leaks are much less problematic than the issues actively protected by CORB (e.g. Spectre).

This protection complements CORB since it is an opt-in defense, whereas CORB blocks some cross-origin reads by default. Unfortunately, similar to CORB, applications can introduce a new XS-Leak if they misconfigure the use of this protection.
A webpage will introduce an XS-Leak if CORP is enforced based on user data.</description></item></channel></rss>
