This section should focus on defensive design techniques to prevent XS-Leaks from happening. Some ideas:

- The way applications use iframes to display information based on a user query (search system)
- How applications use Fetch Metadata with Vary headers to prevent cache probing attacks and what problems might occur with improper deployments. Are there any drawbacks of deploying this?
- How to ensure all application endpoints implement certain Headers to have the same behavior across different states.
- Quick strategies to mitigate reported XS-Leaks, as a short-term solution before deploying web platform security features.
