There are a number of different approaches applications can use to defend against cache probing-based XS-Leaks. These approaches are explained in the following sections.

# Cache Protection via `Cache-Control` Headers

If it is acceptable to disable caching, doing so provides a strong defense against cache probing attacks. Disabling caching means that every time someone loads a resource, the resource has to be fetched again. To disable caching, set a `Cache-Control: no-store` header on every single response that you wish to protect.

Advantages:
* Supported by all major browsers

Disadvantages:
* Negatively impacts site performance

# Cache Protection via Random Tokens

Rather than disabling caching, applications can include additional data in URLs in order to defend against cache probing attacks. This can be achieved by including a random token in the URL of every subresource that you reference. If an attacker cannot guess this random token, then the attacker cannot determine whether items are in the cache via any straightforward techniques.

{{< hint example >}}
Suppose that every page on your application loads the user's profile photo: `/user/<USERNAME>.png`. An attacker could check which user is signed in by probing the cache for `/user/john.png`, `/user/jane.png`, and so on.

This is where a random token can come into play. If implemented, the application takes the user's profile photo from `/user/<USERNAME>.png?cache_buster=<RANDOM_TOKEN>` on every load. The server does not need to do anything with this random token. It is there purely to ensure that there is no way for an attacker to probe the cache without knowing the random token.

If implemented carefully, an application could even have a user-specific random token that is reused across page loads. This would allow subresources to still be cached since the URL would remain constant for a given user.

Advantages:
* Supported by every major browser
* Does not break caching

Disadvantages:
* Difficult to implement

# Cache Protection via Fetch Metadata

[Fetch-Metadata]({{< ref "../opt-in/fetch-metadata.md" >}}) is meant to allow servers to determine how and why a request was initiated on the client side. One piece of information that is exposed is the [`Sec-Fetch-Site`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Site) header which specifies whether a request is coming from the same origin or a different origin. This can be combined with the [`Vary`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary) header in order to force the browser to segment the cache based on whether a request is made from the same origin or a different origin.

This is done by setting `Vary: Sec-Fetch-Site` on all resources you wish to protect.

{{< hint example >}}
Assume we have the resource `cdn.example.com/image.png` that we wish to protect from cache probing attacks. If we set `Vary: Sec-Fetch-Site` on it, this leads to the following behavior:

1. If `example.com` tries to load the resource, the request is initiated by the same site so it is cached under `(SFS: same-site, resource_url)`
2. If `cdn.example.com` tries to load the resource, the request is initiated by the same origin so it is cached under `(SFS: same-origin, resource_url)`
3. If `evil.com` tries to load the resource, the request is initiated by a different site so it is cached under `(SFS: cross-site, resource_url)`

Note that this means cross-site requests are separated from same-site and same-origin requests.

Advantages:
* Supported by every major browser
* Does not break caching

Disadvantages:
* Cross-site subresources loaded on the page are not protected (e.g. subresources from CDNs)
* If third parties load the resource, they are not protected
