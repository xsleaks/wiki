# Isolation Policies

This section contains our proposition of the deployment of the introduced defenses, called Isolation Policies.

* To defend against cross-site framing with [Fetch Metadata]({{< ref "../opt-in/fetch-metadata.md">}}), check [Framing Isolation Policy]({{< ref "./framing-isolation.md" >}}).
* To defend against cross-site requests for common resources (e.g. scripts, images, fetch) with [Fetch Metadata]({{< ref "../opt-in/fetch-metadata.md">}}), check [Resource Isolation Policy]({{< ref "./resource-isolation.md" >}}).
* To defend against cross-site navigational requests with [Fetch Metadata]({{< ref "../opt-in/fetch-metadata.md">}}), check [Navigation Isolation Policy]({{< ref "./navigation-isolation.md" >}}).
* To defend against all cross-site interactions with either [Fetch Metadata]({{< ref "../opt-in/fetch-metadata.md">}}), SameSite cookies or Referer, check [Strict Isolation Policy]({{< ref "./strict-isolation.md" >}})
