# Secure Defaults

This section contains articles discussing two types of secure defaults:

* [Partitioned Caches]({{< ref "./partitioned-cache.md" >}}) – Ensure that cache resources cannot be shared in between different sites.
* [Cross Origin Read Blocking (CORB)]({{< ref "./corb.md" >}}) – Prevents certain types of responses from being referenced by certain classes of requests.
