## Explanation

A good portion of XS-Leaks has multiple alternatives to execute the same attack, some in **common** with each other. For instance, some XS-Leaks abuse properties of `iframes` to succeed which can be fully mitigated by deploying [Framing Protections]({{< ref "xfo.md" >}}). However, this same group of XS-Leaks can usually be abused by other **common** alternatives, that need other protections. One of those alternatives consists of navigating the user away using `window.open`, allowing attackers to gain a reference to the opened `window`. With this reference an attacker can take advantage of some of its properties to perform multiple requests, ultimately inferring private information from them.

Exploiting XS-Leaks with `window` references is seen as the last available option mainly because the user can see it happen. However, it's usually the right way when:

- A page sets [Framing Protections]({{< ref "xfo.md" >}})
- A page sets [`Same-Site Cookies` with `Lax` Mode]({{< ref "same-site-cookies.md" >}}) (navigating a `window` is a top-level navigation)

To prevent untrusted origins from gaining arbitrary `window` references to a page, applications can deploy Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP)[^1]. With COOP, applications are in control of who is allowed to have a reference to their pages, thus mitigating XS-Leaks which make use of such techniques.

## Considerations

Since COOP is an `opt-in` mechanism and a very recent one, can be overlooked by Developers and Security Engineers. Nonetheless, it’s important to highlight the importance of this Defense Mechanism as it is the **only way** to prevent attackers from exploiting XS-Leaks which makes use of `window` references (unless Same-Site Cookies Strict Mode can be widely deployed).

## Deployment

### Table Caption

- **COOP Protection** - At least one attack alternative of the XS-Leak relies on `window` references
- **Full Mitigation** - Does not fully mitigate an XS-Leak if an alternative attack vector that does not rely on `window` references
