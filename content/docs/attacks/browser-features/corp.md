## Explanation

[Cross-Origin Resource Policy]({{< ref "../../defenses/opt-in/corp.md" >}}) (CORP) is a web platform security feature that allows websites to prevent certain resources from being loaded by other origins. This protection complements [CORB]({{< ref "../../defenses/secure-defaults/corb.md" >}}) since it is an opt-in defense, whereas CORB blocks some cross-origin reads by default. Unfortunately, similar to [CORB]({{< ref "corb.md" >}}), applications can introduce a new XS-Leak if they misconfigure the use of this protection.

A webpage will introduce an XS-Leak if `CORP` is enforced based on user data. If a page search feature enforces `CORP` when showing results, but doesn't do so when returning no results, an attacker will be able to distinguish the two scenarios. This occurs because a page/resource protected by `CORP` will return an error when fetched cross-origin.

## Defense

An application can avoid this XS-Leak if it guarantees `CORP` is deployed in all application resources/endpoints. Moreover, generic security mechanisms that allow the invalidation of cross-site requests will also help prevent this attack.
