Network Timing side-channels have been present on the web since its inception [^1] [^4]. These attacks have had different levels of impact over time, gaining new attention when browsers started shipping high-precision timers like [performance.now()]({{< ref "clocks.md#performancenow" >}}).

To obtain timing measurements, attackers must use a [clock]({{< ref "clocks.md" >}}), either an implicit or an explicit one. These clocks are usually interchangeable for the purposes of XS-Leaks and only vary in accuracy and availability. For simplicity, this article assumes the use of the `performance.now()` API, an explicit clock present in all modern browsers.

This side-channel allows attackers to infer information from a cross-site request based on how much time it takes to complete that request [^2]. The network timing measurement may vary based on the user state and it's usually connected to the:

- Resource size.
- Computation time in the backend.
- Number and size of sub-resources.
- [Cache status]({{< ref "../cache-probing.md" >}}).

{{< hint tip >}}
Learn more about the different types of clocks in the [Clocks article]({{< ref "clocks.md" >}}).
{{< /hint >}}

## Modern Web Timing Attacks

The [performance.now()]({{< ref "clocks.md#performancenow" >}}) API can be used to measure how much time it takes to perform a request:

```javascript
// Start the clock
var start = performance.now()

// Measure how long it takes to complete the fetch requests
fetch('https://example.org', {
  mode: 'no-cors',
  credentials: 'include'
}).then(() => {
  // When fetch finishes, calculate the difference
  var time = performance.now() - start;
  console.log("The request took %d ms.", time);
});
```
## Onload events

A similar process can be used to measure how long it takes to fetch a resource by simply watching for an `onload` event:

```javascript
// Create a script element pointing to the page we want to time
var script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = "https://example.org";
document.body.appendChild(script);

// Start the clock
var start = performance.now();

// When script loads, caculate the time it took to finish the request
script.onload = () => {
  var time = performance.now() - start;
  console.log("The request took %d ms.", time)
}
```
{{< hint tip >}}
A similar technique can be used for other HTML elements, e.g. `<img>`, `<link>`, or `<iframe>`, which could be used in scenarios where other techniques fail. For example, if [Fetch Metadata]({{< ref "/docs/defenses/opt-in/fetch-metadata.md">}}) blocks loading a resource into a script tag, it may allow loading it into an image tag.
{{< /hint >}}
{{< hint tip >}}
An alternative way could be to use `image.complete` property. More information [here](https://riccardomerlano.github.io/xs-leaks/cache-probing-through-image.complete-property/).
{{< /hint >}}

## Cross-window Timing Attacks

An attacker can also measure the network timing of a page by opening a new window with `window.open` and waiting for the `window` to start loading. The snippet below shows how to make this measurement:

```javascript
// Open a new window to measure when the iframe starts loading
var win = window.open('https://example.org');
// Measure the initial time
var start = performance.now();
// Define the loop
function measure(){
  try{
    // If the page has loaded, then it will be on a different origin
    // so `win.origin` will throw an exception
    win.origin;
    // If the window is still same-origin, immediately repeat the loop but
    // without blocking the event loop
    setTimeout(measure, 0);
  }catch(e){
    // Once the window has loaded, calculate the time difference
    var time = performance.now() - start;
    console.log('It took %d ms to load the window', time);
  }
}
// Initiate the loop that breaks when the window switches origins
measure();
```
{{< hint note >}}
Note that this POC uses `setTimeout` in order to create the rough equivalent of a `while(true)` loop. It is necessary to implement it in this way in order to avoid blocking the JS event loop.
{{< /hint >}}
{{< hint tip >}}
This technique can also be adapted to measure the Execution Timing of a page by [making the event loop busy]({{< ref "execution-timing.md#busy-event-loop" >}}).
{{< /hint >}}

## Unload events

The [`unload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/unload_event) and [`beforeunload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/beforeunload_event) events can be used to measure the time it takes to fetch a resource. This works because `beforeunload` is triggered when the browser requests a new navigation request, while `unload` is triggered when that navigation actually occurs. Because of this behaviour, it is possible to calculate the time difference between these two events and measure the time it took the browser to complete fetching the resource. 

{{< hint info >}}
The time difference between `unload` and `beforeunload` is not affected by the `x-frame-options` (XFO) header, because the event is triggered before the browser learns about the response headers. 
{{< /hint >}}

The below snippet makes use of the [SharedArrayBuffer clock]({{< ref "clocks.md#sharedarraybuffer-and-web-workers" >}}) which needs to be initiated before the snippet is ran:
```javascript
// Create a Shared buffer to be used by a WebWorker
var sharedBuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT);
var sharedArray = new Uint32Array(sharedBuffer);

// Follow the steps of initiating the WebWorker and then call
worker.postMessage(sharedBuffer);

var start;
iframe.contentWindow.onbeforeunload = () => {
  // Get the "time" during the navigation
  start = Atomics.load(sharedArray, 0);
}
iframe.contentWindow.onpagehide = () => {
  // Get the "time" after the navigation
  var end = Atomics.load(sharedArray, 0);
  console.log('The difference between events was %d iterations', end - start);
};
```

{{< hint tip >}}
The [SharedArrayBuffer clock]({{< ref "clocks.md#sharedarraybuffer-and-web-workers" >}}) was used to create a high-resolution timer. However, the time difference between the `beforeunload` and `unload` events of iframes can be measured with other clocks as well, e.g. *performance.now()*.
{{< /hint >}}
{{< hint tip >}}
The presented snippet makes use of iframes to make the measurement. A variation of this attack can also use window references, which is harder to protect against.

## Sandboxed Frame Timing Attacks

If a page doesn't have any [Framing Protections]({{< ref "../../defenses/opt-in/xfo.md" >}}) implemented, an attacker can time how long it takes for the page and all subresources to load over the network. By default, the `onload` handler for an iframe is invoked after all the resources have been loaded and all JavaScript has finished executing. But, an attacker can eliminate the noise of script execution by including the [`sandbox`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) attribute in the `<iframe>`. This attribute blocks a lot of features including JavaScript execution, which results in almost pure network measurement.

```javascript
var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
// Set the URL of the destination website
iframe.src = "https://example.org";
// Set sandbox attribute to block script execution
iframe.sandbox = "";
document.body.appendChild(iframe);

// Measure the time before the request was initiated
var start = performance.now();

iframe.onload = () => {
  // When iframe loads, calculate the time difference
  var time = performance.now() - start;
  console.log("The iframe and subresources took %d ms to load.", time)
}
```

## Timeless Timing Attacks

Other types of attacks do not consider the notion of time to perform a timing attack [^3]. Timeless attacks consist of fitting two `HTTP` requests (the baseline and the attacked request) in a single packet, to guarantee they arrive to the server at the same time. The server *will* process the requests concurrently, and return a response based on their execution time as soon as possible. One of the two requests will arrive first, allowing the attacker to infer the time difference by comparing the order in which the requests arrived.

The advantage of this technique is the independence from network jitter and uncertain delays, something that is always present in the remaining techniques.

{{< hint important >}}
This attack is limited to specific versions of HTTP and joint scenarios. It makes certain assumptions and has requirements regarding server behavior.
