## Explanation

Detecting if a cross-site page triggered a navigation can be useful to an attacker. This can be done in two ways:
- Using an `iframe` and counting the number of times the `onload` event is triggered.
- Checking the value of `History.length`, accessible through any `window` reference, gives the number of entries in the history of a victim either changed by `History.pushState` or regular navigations. To get the value of `History.length` an attacker changes the location of the `window` reference with the target website, changes back to same-origin, and finally reads the value.

### Why is this a problem?

Similarly to the [Frame Counting Attack]({{< ref "../attacks/frame-counting.md" >}}), triggering navigations can be problem when they are done depending on user private information. The main problem is the lack of consistency in pages to always have the same behavior.

#### Case Scenarios

- An online bank decides to redirect wealthy users to unmissable stock opportunities by triggering a navigation to a reserved space in the website when users are consulting the account balance. If this is only done to a specific group of users, it becomes possible for an attacker to leak the "client status" of the user.

## Real World Example

A vulnerability reported to Twitter used this technique to leak the contents of private tweets using [XS-Search](https://TODO). This attack was possible because the page would only trigger a navigation depending on whether there were results to the user query [^1].
