These references become available when using or allowing iframe and window.open. The references provide (limited) information about the window as they still respect the same-origin policy.
One of the accessible attributes is window.length which provides the number of frames in the window. This attribute can provide valuable information about a page to an attacker.</description></item><item><title>Navigations</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/</guid><description>Detecting if a cross-site page triggered a navigation (or didn&amp;rsquo;t) can be useful to an attacker. For example, a website may trigger a navigation in a certain endpoint depending on the status of the user.
To detect if any kind of navigation occurred, an attacker can:
Use an iframe and count the number of times the onload event is triggered. Check the value of history.length, accessible through any window reference.</description></item><item><title>Network Timing</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/</guid><description>Network Timing side-channels have been present on the web since its beginning 1 2. These attacks have had different levels of impact over time, gaining new attention when browsers started shipping high precision timers like performance.now().
To obtain timing measurements attackers must use a clock, either an implicit or explicit one. These clocks are usually interchangeable for the purposes of XS-Leaks and only vary in accuracy and availability. For simplicity, this article will assume use of the performance.</description></item><item><title>Execution Timing</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/execution-timing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/execution-timing/</guid><description>Measuring the time of JavaScript execution in a browser can give attackers information on when certain events are triggered, and how long some operations take.
Timing the Event Loop # JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s concurrency model is based on a single-threaded event loop which means it can only run one task at a time. If, for example, some time-consuming task blocks the event loop, the user can perceive a freeze on a page as a result of the UI thread being starved.</description></item><item><title>ID Attribute</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/id-attribute/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/id-attribute/</guid><description>The id attribute is widely used to identify some HTML elements. Unfortunately, cross-origin websites can determine whether a given id is set anywhere on the page by leveraging the focus event and URL fragments. If https://example.com/foo#bar is loaded, the browser will attempt to scroll to the element with id=&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;. This can be detected cross-origin by loading https://example.com/foo#bar in an iframe and if there is an element with id=&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot; then the focus event will fire.</description></item></channel></rss>
